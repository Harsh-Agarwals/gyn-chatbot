They \\ncarry messages to different parts \\nof the body and result in certain \\nchanges taking place. Female \\nhormones, which include oestrogen \\nand progesterone, control many of \\nthe events of a woman’s monthly \\ncycle, such as the release of eggs \\nfrom her ovaries and the thickening \\nof her uterus lining.\\nDuring pregnancy, your hormone \\nlevels change. As soon as you \\nhave conceived, the amount of \\noestrogen and progesterone in your \\nblood increases. This causes the \\nuterus lining to build up, the blood \\nsupply to your uterus and breasts \\nto increase and the muscles of your \\nuterus to relax to make room for  \\nthe growing baby.\\nThe increase in hormone levels \\ncan affect how you feel. You may \\nhave mood swings, feel tearful or \\nbe easily irritated. For a while you \\nmay feel that you cannot control \\nyour emotions, but these symptoms \\nshould ease after the ﬁrst three \\nmonths of your pregnancy.\\nBOY OR GIRL?\\nEvery normal human cell contains \\n46 chromosomes, except for male \\nsperm and female eggs. These \\ncontain 23 chromosomes each. \\nWhen a sperm fertilises an egg, the \\n23 chromosomes from the father \\npair with the 23 from the mother, \\nmaking 46 in all. \\nChromosomes are tiny, thread-like \\nstructures which each carry about \\n2,000 genes. Genes determine \\na baby’s inherited \\ncharacteristics, such as \\nhair and eye colour, \\nblood group, height \\nand build. A fertilised \\negg contains one sex \\nchromosome from \\nits mother and one \\nfrom its father. The \\nsex chromosome from \\nthe mother’s egg is always the same \\nand is known as the X chromosome.  \\nBut the sex chromosome from  \\nthe father’s sperm can be an X or  \\na Y chromosome. \\nIf the egg is fertilised by a sperm \\ncontaining an X chromosome,  \\nthe baby will be a girl (XX). If the \\nsperm contains a Y chromosome, \\nthe baby will be a boy (XY).\\nSperm is about 1/25th of a millimetre long and has a head, neck and tail.  \\nThe tail moves from side to side so that the sperm can swim up the vagina \\ninto the uterus and fallopian tubes.\\nOne egg or ovum (occasionally two or more) is released from the  \\nwoman’s ovaries every month.

For you to get \\npregnant, the egg must be fertilised \\nby a sperm within this time. Sperm \\ncan live for up to seven days inside \\na woman’s body.

They are the result of  \\ntwo eggs being fertilised by two \\nsperm at the same time. The babies \\nmay be of the same sex or different \\nsexes, and will probably look no \\nmore alike than any other brothers \\nand sisters. A third of all twins  \\nwill be identical and two-thirds  \\nnon-identical. \\nTwins happen in about 1 in every  \\n65 pregnancies. A couple is more \\nlikely to have twins if there are  \\ntwins in the woman’s family.  \\nTriplets occur naturally in 1 in \\n10,000 pregnancies and quads \\nare even rarer. Nowadays, the use \\nof drugs in the treatment of \\ninfertility has made multiple \\nbirths more common. \\nAre you carrying \\ntwins?\\nYou might suspect that you \\nare carrying more than \\none baby if:\\n• you are very sick in \\nearly pregnancy\\n• you seem bigger than you should \\nbe for your ‘dates’\\n• twins run in your family, or \\n• you have had fertility treatment. \\nIt is usually possible to ﬁnd out \\nthrough your dating ultrasound \\nscan, which happens between eight \\nand 14 weeks (see page 48). \\nYou should be told at this point \\nwhether the babies share a placenta \\n(are identical) or if they have two \\nseparate placentas, in which case \\nthey can be either identical or \\nnon-identical. If this cannot be \\ndetermined, you should be offered \\na further scan.

So when you \\nare ‘four weeks pregnant’, it is \\nactually about two weeks after \\nyou conceived. Pregnancy normally \\nlasts for 37–42 weeks from the \\nﬁrst day of your last period.  \\nThe average is 40 weeks.  \\nIf you are not sure about the date \\nof your last period, then your early \\nscan (see page 48) will give a  \\ngood indication of when your  \\nbaby will be due. \\nIn the very early weeks, the \\ndeveloping baby is called an \\nembryo.

The  \\nfertilised egg moves slowly along \\nyour fallopian tube towards your \\nuterus. It begins as one single cell, \\nwhich divides again and again.  \\nBy the time the fertilised egg \\nreaches your uterus, it has become \\na mass of over 100 cells, called an \\nembryo. It is still growing. Once in \\nyour uterus, the embryo attaches \\nitself into your uterus lining.  \\nThis is called implantation.\\nWEEKS 4–5\\nWeek 4\\nThe actual size of the embryo  \\nis about 5mm\\nThe embryo now settles into your \\nuterus lining. The outer cells reach \\nout like roots to link with your \\nblood supply. The inner cells form \\ntwo – and then later three – layers. \\nEach of these layers will grow to be \\ndifferent parts of your baby’s body. \\nOne layer becomes their brain and \\nnervous system, skin, eyes and ears. \\nAnother layer becomes their lungs, \\nstomach and gut. The third layer \\nbecomes their heart, blood, muscles \\nand bones. \\nThe ﬁfth week is when you will \\nmiss your period. At this time, most \\nwomen are only just beginning to \\nthink they may be pregnant. \\nAlready your baby’s nervous system \\nis starting to develop. A groove \\nforms in the top layer of cells. The \\ncells fold up and round to make a \\nhollow tube called the neural tube. \\nThis will become your baby’s brain \\nand spinal cord, so the tube has a \\n‘head end’ and a ‘tail end’. Defects \\nin this tube are the cause of spina \\nbiﬁda (see page 49). The heart is  \\nalso forming and your baby already \\nhas some blood vessels. A string of \\nthese blood vessels connects your \\nbaby to you – this will become the \\numbilical cord.\\nWEEKS 6–7\\nThere is now a large bulge where \\nyour baby’s heart is and a bump \\nfor the head because the brain is \\ndeveloping.

On the body, bumps are \\nforming that will become muscles \\nand bones. And small swellings \\n(called ‘limb buds’) show where the \\narms and legs are growing.

Don’t \\neat mould-ripened soft cheese, \\nlike Brie, Camembert and others \\nwith a similar rind. You should \\nalso avoid soft blue-veined cheese, \\nlike Danish blue. These are made \\nwith mould and they can contain \\nlisteria, a type of bacteria that can \\nharm your unborn baby. Although \\nlisteriosis is a very rare infection, \\nit is important to take special \\nprecautions during pregnancy \\nbecause even the mild form of \\nthe illness in the mother can lead \\nto miscarriage, stillbirth or severe \\nillness in a newborn baby. You can \\neat hard cheeses such as cheddar \\nand parmesan, and processed \\ncheeses made from pasteurised \\nmilk such as cottage cheese, \\nmozzarella and cheese spreads. \\n• Pâté. Avoid all types of pâté, \\nincluding vegetable pâtés, as  \\nthey can contain listeria.\\n• Raw or partially cooked eggs. \\nMake sure that eggs are thoroughly  \\ncooked until the whites and yolks \\nare solid. This prevents the risk \\nof salmonella food poisoning. \\nAvoid foods that contain raw and \\nundercooked eggs, such as home-\\nmade mayonnaise.\\n• Raw or undercooked meat. \\nCook all meat and poultry \\nthoroughly so that there is no \\ntrace of pink or blood. Take \\nparticular care with sausages and  \\nminced meat. It is ﬁne to eat steaks  \\nand other whole cuts of beef and \\nlamb rare, as long as the outside \\nhas been properly cooked or sealed.\\n• Liver products. Don’t eat liver, or \\nliver products like liver pâté or liver \\nsausage, as they may contain a lot \\nof vitamin A. Too much vitamin A \\ncan harm your baby. \\n• Supplements containing \\nvitamin A. Don’t take high-\\ndose multivitamin supplements, \\nﬁsh liver oil supplements or any \\nsupplements containing vitamin A.\\n• Some types of ﬁsh. Don’t eat \\nshark, marlin and swordﬁsh, and \\nlimit the amount of tuna you eat \\nto no more than two tuna steaks \\na week (about 140g cooked or \\n170g raw each) or four medium-\\nsized cans of tuna a week (about \\n140g when drained).

Don’t eat more than two \\nportions of oily ﬁsh per week.  \\nOily ﬁsh includes fresh tuna \\n(but not canned tuna), salmon, \\nmackerel, sardines and trout.\\n• Raw shellﬁsh. Eat cooked rather \\nthan raw shellﬁsh as they can \\ncontain harmful bacteria and viruses \\nthat can cause food poisoning. \\n• Peanuts. If you would like to \\neat peanuts or foods containing \\npeanuts (such as peanut butter) \\nduring pregnancy, you can choose \\nto do so as part of a healthy \\nbalanced diet, unless you are \\nallergic to them or your health \\nprofessional advises you not to.\\n You may have heard that some \\nwomen have, in the past, chosen \\nnot to eat peanuts when they \\nwere pregnant. This is because the \\ngovernment previously advised \\nwomen that they may wish to \\navoid eating peanuts during \\npregnancy if there was a history  \\nof allergy in their child’s immediate \\nfamily (such as asthma, eczema, \\nhayfever, food allergy or other \\ntypes of allergy). But this advice \\nhas now been changed because \\nthe latest research has shown that \\nthere is no clear evidence to say \\nif eating or not eating peanuts \\nduring pregnancy affects the \\nchances of your baby developing \\na peanut allergy. \\n• Unpasteurised milk. Drink only \\npasteurised or UHT milk which \\nhas been pasteurised. If only raw \\nor green-top milk is available, boil \\nit ﬁrst. Don’t drink unpasteurised \\ngoats’ or sheep’s milk or eat \\ncertain food that is made out of \\nthem, e.g. soft goats’ cheese.\\nPREPARING FOOD\\n26\\n• Wash fruit, vegetables and salads \\nto remove all traces of soil, which \\nmay contain toxoplasma. This can \\ncause toxoplasmosis, which can \\nharm your baby (see page 37).\\n• Heat ready-meals until they are \\npiping hot all the way through. \\nThis is especially important for \\nmeals containing poultry.\\n• Keep leftovers covered in the \\nfridge and use within two days.\\n• Wash all surfaces and utensils, \\nand your hands, after preparing \\nraw meat. This will help to avoid \\ninfection with toxoplasma.\\nYour weight \\nMost women gain between \\n10kg and 12.5kg (22–28lb) while \\npregnant. Weight gain varies \\na great deal and depends on \\nyour weight before pregnancy. \\nMuch of the extra weight is due \\nto the baby growing. Putting \\non too much weight can affect \\nyour health and increase your \\nblood pressure. Equally, it is \\nimportant that you do not \\ndiet, but eat healthily. Try and \\nstay active by keeping up your \\nnormal daily activity or exercise. \\nIf you are concerned, talk to \\nyour midwife or GP. They may \\ngive you advice if you weigh \\nmore than 100kg (about 15½ \\nstone) or less than 50kg (about \\n8 stone).'),\n",

There are some \\nvitamins and minerals that are \\nespecially important:\\n•  Folic acid. Folic acid is important \\nfor pregnancy as it can reduce \\nthe risk of neural tube defects \\nsuch as spina biﬁda. If you are \\nthinking about getting pregnant, \\nyou should take a 400 microgram \\nfolic acid tablet every day until \\nyou are 12 weeks pregnant. If \\nyou did not take folic acid before \\nyou conceived, you should start \\nas soon as you ﬁnd out that you \\nare pregnant. You should also eat \\nfoods that contain folic acid, such \\nas green leafy vegetables, fortiﬁed \\nbreakfast cereals and brown rice. \\nSome breakfast cereals, breads \\nand margarines have folic acid \\nadded to them. If you already \\nhave a baby with spina biﬁda, \\nor if you have coeliac disease or \\ndiabetes or take anti-epileptic \\nmedicines, ask your GP or midwife  \\nfor more advice. You will need to \\ntake a bigger dose of folic acid. \\n•  Vitamin D. You need vitamin D\\nto keep your bones healthy and \\nto provide your baby with enough \\nvitamin D for the ﬁrst few months \\nof their life. Vitamin D regulates \\nthe amount of calcium and \\nphosphate in the body, and these \\nare needed to help keep bones \\nand teeth healthy. Deﬁciency of \\nvitamin D can cause children’s \\nbones to soften and can lead \\nto rickets. You should take a \\nsupplement of 10 micrograms of \\nvitamin D every day. Only a few \\nfoods contain vitamin D, including \\noily ﬁsh like sardines, fortiﬁed \\nmargarines, some breakfast \\ncereals and taramasalata. \\n The best source of vitamin D is \\nsummer sunlight. The amount of \\ntime you need in the sun to make \\nenough vitamin D is different \\nfor every person and depends \\non things like skin type, time of \\nday and time of the year. But \\nyou don’t need to sunbathe: the \\namount of sun you need to make \\nenough vitamin D is less than the \\namount that causes tanning or \\nburning. If you have dark skin or \\nalways cover your skin, you may \\nbe at particular risk of vitamin D \\ndeﬁciency. Talk to your midwife \\nor doctor if you are worried \\nabout this. (See also ‘Vitamin \\nsupplements’ on page 28.)\\n•  Iron. If you are short of iron, \\nyou will probably get very \\ntired and you can become \\nanaemic. Lean meat, green, leafy \\nvegetables, dried fruit and nuts \\n(see page 26 about avoiding \\npeanuts) all contain iron. Many \\nbreakfast cereals have iron \\nadded. If the iron level in your \\nblood becomes low, your GP or \\nmidwife will advise you to take \\niron supplements. These are \\navailable as tablets or a liquid.\\n•  Vitamin C. You need vitamin C \\nas it may help you to absorb iron. \\nCitrus fruits, tomatoes, broccoli, \\npeppers, blackcurrants, potatoes \\nand some pure fruit juices are \\ngood sources of vitamin C.  \\nIf your iron levels are low, it may \\nhelp to drink orange juice with \\nan iron-rich meal.\\n•  Calcium.

If you \\nhave hepatitis B, or are infected \\nduring pregnancy, you can pass \\nthe infection to your baby at birth. \\nYou will be offered a blood test for \\nhepatitis B as part of your antenatal \\ncare (see page 47). Babies who \\nare at risk should be immunised \\nat birth. This is 90–95% effective \\nin preventing them from getting \\nhepatitis B and developing long-\\nterm infection. The ﬁrst dose is given \\nwithin 24 hours of birth and two \\nmore doses are given at one and \\ntwo months, with a booster dose \\nat 12 months. A few babies may \\nalso need an injection of hepatitis \\nB immunoglobulin soon after birth. \\nYour baby will be tested for  \\nhepatitis B infection at 12 months. \\nAny babies who have become \\ninfected should be referred for \\nspecialist assessment and follow-up.\\nHepatitis C\\nHepatitis C is a virus that infects the \\nliver. Many people with hepatitis C  \\nmay have no symptoms and be \\nunaware that they are infected. If \\nyou have hepatitis C, you might pass \\nthe infection to your baby, although \\nthe risk is much lower than with \\nhepatitis B or HIV. This cannot be \\nprevented at present. Your baby can \\nbe tested for hepatitis C. If they are \\ninfected, they can be referred for \\nspecialist assessment.\\nHerpes \\nGenital herpes infection can be \\ncaught through genital contact with \\nan infected person or from oral sex \\nwith someone who has oral herpes \\n(cold sores) and can be dangerous \\nfor a newborn baby. Initial infection \\ncauses very painful blisters or \\nulcers on the genitals. Less severe \\nattacks usually occur for some years \\nafterwards. If you or your partner \\nare infected, use condoms or avoid \\nsex during an attack. Avoid oral \\nsex if either of you have cold sores \\nor active genital herpes. Tell your \\ndoctor or midwife if either you  \\nor your partner have recurring \\nherpes or develop the symptoms \\ndescribed above. If your ﬁrst \\ninfection occurs in pregnancy, there \\nis treatment available. If your ﬁrst \\ninfection occurs towards the end  \\nof your pregnancy or during \\nlabour, a caesarean section may  \\nbe recommended to reduce the  \\nrisk of transmission to your baby.\\nChickenpox \\nAround 95% of women are \\nimmune to chickenpox.

Chickenpox infection in \\npregnancy can be dangerous for \\nboth mother and baby, so seek \\nadvice as soon as possible.\\nToxoplasmosis\\nThis infection can damage \\nyour baby if you catch it during \\npregnancy, so take precautions  \\n(see page 38). Most women  \\nhave already had the infection \\nbefore pregnancy and will be \\nimmune. If you feel you may \\nhave been at risk, talk to your GP , \\nmidwife or obstetrician.

Later in pregnancy \\nyour baby will develop its own \\npattern of movements – which  \\nyou will soon get to know. \\nThese movements will range \\nfrom kicks and jerks to rolls and \\nripples and you should feel them \\nevery day. At each antenatal \\nappointment, your midwife will \\ntalk to you about the pattern of \\nmovements.

Different \\nmaternity services may use different \\ntests, but all tests carried out in the \\nNHS will meet national standards. \\nDiscuss the tests and what they \\nmean with your midwife.\\nScreening tests can:\\n• reassure you that your baby \\nhas no detected structural \\nabnormalities\\n• provide you with an opportunity \\nto see your baby during the scan\\n• give you time to prepare for the \\narrival of a baby with special needs \\n• allow you to consider the \\ntermination of an affected baby.\\nTests can also provide valuable \\ninformation for your care during \\nthe pregnancy. However, no test \\ncan guarantee that your baby will \\nbe born without an abnormality. \\nNo test is 100% accurate and some \\nabnormalities may remain undetected.\\nDeciding whether to \\nhave tests\\nYou may not want to have a \\nscreening test if you think that you \\nwould continue your pregnancy \\nwhatever the results. If you do have \\na screening test and it suggests an \\nincreased chance of a chromosomal \\nabnormality, you will be offered \\ndiagnostic tests, which will give \\na more deﬁnite diagnosis.

Some \\narguments \\nmay be \\nnothing to \\ndo with the \\npregnancy, but \\nothers may be \\nbecause one of \\nyou is worried about the future \\nand how you are going to cope. \\nIt’s important to realise that during \\npregnancy there are understandable \\nreasons for the odd difﬁculty \\nbetween you, and good reasons for \\nfeeling closer and more loving. \\nOne practical question you will need \\nto discuss is how you will cope with \\nlabour, and whether your partner \\nwants to be there. Many fathers  \\ndo want to be present at their \\nbaby’s birth. The chapter on labour \\nand birth (page 85) gives some \\nsuggestions for ways in which \\nfathers can help, and what it can \\nmean for them to share  \\nthis experience.\\nIf your relationship is particularly \\nproblematic, or is abusive, do get \\nhelp.

Your partner’s penis \\ncannot penetrate beyond your \\nvagina, and the baby cannot tell \\nwhat is going on! However, it is \\nnormal for your sex drive to change \\nand you should not worry about this, \\nbut do talk about it with your partner.\\nLater in pregnancy, an orgasm \\n– or even sex itself – can set off \\ncontractions (known as Braxton \\nHicks contractions – see page 87). \\nYou will feel the muscles of your \\nuterus go hard. There is no need for \\nalarm, as this is perfectly normal. \\nIf it feels uncomfortable, try your \\nrelaxation techniques or just lie \\nquietly till the contractions pass.\\nYour midwife or doctor will probably \\nadvise you to avoid sex if you have \\nany heavy bleeding in pregnancy, \\nsince this risks infection in the baby \\n– especially if your waters have \\nbroken (see page 87).\\nSome couples ﬁnd having sex \\nvery enjoyable during pregnancy, \\nwhile others simply feel that they \\ndon’t want to have sex. You can \\nﬁnd other ways of being loving \\nor of making love. The most \\nimportant thing is to talk about \\nyour feelings with each other. \\nWhile sex is safe for most \\ncouples in pregnancy, it may not \\nbe all that easy. You will probably \\nneed to ﬁnd different positions. \\nThis can be a time to explore \\nand experiment together. Even \\nearly in pregnancy it can become \\nuncomfortable to have sex with \\nyour partner on top.

When \\nyou are having regular contractions \\nthat last more than 30 seconds and \\nbegin to feel stronger, labour may \\nhave started.

The plug of mucus \\nin the cervix, which has helped to \\nseal the uterus during pregnancy, \\ncomes away and comes out of \\nthe vagina. This small amount of \\nsticky pink mucus is called the \\n‘show’. It usually comes away \\nbefore or in early labour. There \\nshould only be a little blood mixed \\nin with the mucus.

This can \\nmake you feel more in control  \\nand less frightened about what  \\nis going to happen. Read books \\nlike this one, talk to your  \\nmidwife or doctor and attend \\nantenatal classes if they are \\navailable in your area.\\n• Learn how to relax and stay \\ncalm.

Ask if you \\ncan have a bath or use a \\nbirth pool. The water will be \\nkept at a temperature that is \\ncomfortable for you but  \\nit will not be above 37°C.  \\nYour temperature will be \\nmonitored closely. \\n‘Gas and air’ (Entonox)\\nThis is a mixture of oxygen and \\nanother gas called nitrous oxide. \\n‘Gas and air’ will not remove all \\nthe pain, but it can help to reduce \\nit and make it easier to bear.

If not, \\nyou can hire your own machine. \\nTENS has not been shown to be \\neffective during the active phase of \\nlabour. It is probably most effective \\nduring the early stages, when many \\nwomen experience lower-back pain.\\nTENS may be useful if you plan to \\ngive birth at home or while you \\nare at home in the early stages of \\nlabour. If you are interested in TENS, \\nyou should learn how to use it in \\nthe later months of your pregnancy. \\nAsk your midwife or physiotherapist.\\nHow it works\\nElectrodes are taped onto your back \\nand connected by wires to a small, \\nbattery-powered stimulator known \\nas an ‘obstetric pulsar’. Holding the \\npulsar, you give yourself small, safe \\namounts of current. You can move \\naround while using it.\\nIt is believed that TENS works by \\nstimulating your body to produce \\nmore endorphins, which are the \\nbody’s own natural painkillers.  \\nIt also reduces the number of pain \\nsignals that are sent to the brain  \\nby the spinal cord. \\nSide effects\\nThere are no known side effects  \\nfor either you or the baby. \\nIntramuscular \\ninjections of pain-\\nrelieving drugs\\nInjections of drugs like pethidine or \\ndiamorphine can help you to relax, \\nand this can lessen the pain. \\nHow it works\\nYou are given an intramuscular \\ninjection. It takes about 20 minutes \\nto work and the effects last \\nbetween two and four hours. \\nSide effects\\n• It can make some women feel \\nvery ‘woozy’, sick and forgetful. \\n• If it has not worn off towards \\nthe end of labour, it can make it \\ndifﬁcult to push. You might prefer \\nto ask for half a dose initially, to \\nsee how it works for you. \\n• If pethidine or diamorphine are \\ngiven too close to the time of \\ndelivery, it may affect the baby’s \\nbreathing. If it does, an antidote \\nmay be given. \\n• The drugs can interfere with \\nbreastfeeding. \\nEpidural analgesia\\nAn epidural is a special type of \\nlocal anaesthetic. It numbs the \\nnerves which carry pain from the \\nbirth canal to the brain. For most \\nwomen, an epidural gives complete \\npain relief. It can be very helpful for \\nwomen who are having a long or \\nparticularly painful labour, or who \\nare becoming very distressed. \\nAn anaesthetist is the only person \\nwho can give an epidural. If you \\nthink you are going to want one, \\ncheck whether anaesthetists are \\nalways available at your hospital. \\nHow it works\\n• A drip will run ﬂuid into a vein in \\nyour arm. \\n• While you lie on your side or \\nsit up in a curled position, an \\nanaesthetist will clean your back \\nwith antiseptic and numb a small \\narea with some local anaesthetic. \\n• A very small tube will be placed \\ninto your back near the nerves \\nthat carry pain from the uterus. \\nDrugs (usually a mixture of local \\nanaesthetic and opioid) are then \\nadministered through this tube. \\nIt takes about 20 minutes to get \\nthe epidural set up and then \\nanother 10–15 minutes for it to \\nwork. Occasionally it doesn’t work \\nperfectly at ﬁrst, and needs to  \\nbe adjusted. \\n• After it has been set up, the \\nepidural can be ‘topped up’ by  \\nan anaesthetist or midwife, or  \\nyou may be given a machine \\nwhich will let you top up the \\nepidural yourself. \\n• Your contractions and the baby’s \\nheart will need to be continuously \\nmonitored by a machine. This \\nmeans having a belt round your \\nabdomen and possibly a clip \\nattached to your baby’s head.\\nSide effects \\n• Epidurals may make your legs \\nheavy. It depends on the type  \\nof epidural that you have. \\n• An epidural should not make \\nyou feel drowsy or sick.\\n• Your blood pressure can drop. \\nThis is rare, as the drip in your  \\narm will help you to maintain \\ngood blood pressure.\\n• Epidurals can prolong the second \\nstage of labour.

In the third \\nstage the placenta comes away \\nfrom the wall of the uterus and  \\nis also pushed out of the vagina.\\nThe ﬁrst stage of \\nlabour – dilation\\nThe dilation of the cervix\\nThe cervix needs to open to \\nabout 10cm for a baby to pass \\nthrough. This is called ‘fully dilated’. \\nContractions at the start of labour \\nhelp to soften the cervix so that it \\ngradually opens. Sometimes the \\nprocess of softening can take many \\nhours before what midwives refer  \\nto as ‘established labour’. This is \\nwhen your cervix has dilated to at \\nleast 4cm.\\nIf you go into hospital or your \\nmidwifery unit before labour is \\nestablished, you may be asked if \\nyou would prefer to go home again \\nfor a while, rather than spending \\nextra hours in hospital. \\nIf you go home, you should make \\nsure that you eat and drink, as you \\nwill need energy. At night, try to  \\nget comfortable and relaxed. \\nIf you can, try to sleep. A warm bath \\nor shower may help you to relax. \\nDuring the day, keep upright and \\ngently active. This helps the baby \\nto move down into the pelvis and \\nhelps the cervix to dilate. \\nOnce labour is established, the \\nmidwife will check you from  \\ntime to time to see how you are \\nprogressing. In a ﬁrst labour, the \\ntime from the start of established \\nlabour to full dilation can be \\nbetween 6 and 12 hours. It is  \\noften quicker in subsequent \\npregnancies.\\nYour midwife should be with  \\nyou all the time to support you.  \\nShe will tell you to try not to push \\nuntil your cervix is fully open and \\nthe baby’s head can be seen.  \\nTo help yourself get over the urge \\nto push, try blowing out slowly  \\nand gently or, if the urge is too \\nstrong, in little puffs. Some people \\nﬁnd this easier lying on their side, \\nor on their knees and elbows, to \\nreduce the pressure of the baby’s \\nhead on the cervix.\\nFetal heart monitoring\\nYour baby’s heart will be monitored \\nthroughout labour. Your midwife \\nwill watch for any marked change  \\nin your baby’s heart rate, which \\ncould be a sign that the baby is \\ndistressed and that something \\nneeds to be done to speed up the \\ndelivery.

A general anaesthetic is \\nsometimes used – particularly  \\nif the baby needs to be delivered \\nvery quickly. \\nIf you have an epidural or spinal \\nanaesthesia, you will not feel pain \\n– just some tugging and pulling as \\nyour baby is delivered. A screen will \\nbe put up so that you cannot see \\nwhat is being done. The doctors will \\ntalk to you and let you know what \\nis happening.\\n98\\nPlanned (elective) caesareans\\nA caesarean is ‘elective’ if it is planned in advance.

Don’t use  \\na microwave oven to warm or \\ndefrost breastmilk.\\nSome common \\nbreastfeeding \\nproblems and how  \\nto solve them \\nIt can be hard to ask for help,  \\nbut tackling any problems as soon \\nas they start will give you more  \\ntime to enjoy these early days. \\nIn lots of cases, the solution is as \\nsimple as changing your baby’s \\nposition slightly or feeding them  \\na bit more often. \\nUnsettled feeding \\nIf your baby is unsettled at the \\nbreast and doesn’t seem satisﬁed  \\nby feeds, it may be that they are \\nsucking on the nipple alone, and  \\nso are not getting enough milk.  \\nAsk for help to get your baby into  \\na better feeding position. \\nSore or cracked nipples\\nIf your nipples hurt, take your  \\nbaby off the breast and start  \\nagain. If the pain continues or  \\nyour nipples start to crack or  \\nbleed, ask for help so you get  \\nyour baby latched on comfortably  \\n(see page 114 for information on \\nhow to get help). It can sometimes \\ntake a little while to sort out how \\nto prevent the soreness, but it \\nis important to get support  \\nas soon as possible. \\nThe following suggestions may  \\nalso help:\\n• Try squeezing out a drop or two \\nof your milk at the end of a feed \\nand gently rubbing it into your \\nskin. Let your nipples dry before \\ncovering them.\\n• If you are using breast pads, \\nthey need to be changed at  \\neach feed (if possible, use pads \\nwithout a plastic backing).\\n•\\x00Avoid soap as it dries your \\nskin out. \\n• Wear a cotton bra, so air can \\ncirculate. \\n• Some mothers treat any cracks \\nor bleeding with a thin smear of \\nwhite soft parafﬁn or puriﬁed \\nlanolin. Put the ointment on the \\ncrack (rather than the whole \\nnipple) to help it heal and prevent \\na scab forming. \\nTender breasts, blocked  \\nducts and mastitis\\nMilk can build up in the ducts for \\na variety of reasons. The most \\ncommon are wearing a too-tight \\nbra, missing a feed, or a blow to \\nthe breast. It’s important that you \\ndeal with a blocked duct as soon as \\npossible so that it doesn’t lead to \\nmastitis (inﬂammation of the breast).\\nIf you have mastitis, your breasts will \\nfeel hot and tender. You may see \\na red patch of skin which is painful \\nto touch. You can feel quite ill, as if \\nyou have ﬂu, and you may have a \\ntemperature. This can happen very \\nsuddenly. It is very important to carry \\non breastfeeding as this will help  \\nyou get better more quickly. \\nIf you think you might have  \\nmastitis (or a blocked duct), try  \\nthe following: \\n• Take extra care to make sure \\nyour baby is attached well to  \\nyour breast.\\n•\\x00Feed your baby more often.\\n• Let your baby feed on the \\ntender breast ﬁrst. \\n9FEEDING YOUR BABY\\n109'),\n",

This is called ‘possetting’, \\n‘regurgitation’ or ‘gastric reﬂux’.  \\nIt is not unusual for babies to  \\nbring up quite a lot, but it can  \\nbe upsetting when it happens  \\nand you may be worried that \\nsomething is wrong. \\nAs long as \\nyour baby \\nis gaining \\nweight, there \\nis usually nothing \\nto worry about. But \\nif your baby is violently sick or \\nappears to be in pain, or you are \\nworried for any other reason, talk  \\nto your health visitor or GP . \\nCover your baby’s front when \\nfeeding and have a cloth or paper \\ntowels handy to mop up any mess. \\nCheck too that the hole in your \\nbaby’s teat is not too big, as giving \\nmilk too quickly can cause sickness. \\nSitting your baby upright in a baby \\nchair after a feed can also help.  \\nThe problem usually stops after  \\nsix months when your baby is \\nstarting on solid foods and drinking \\nless milk. \\nIf your baby brings up a lot of milk, \\nremember that they are likely to \\nbe hungry again quite quickly.  \\nDon’t force your baby to take  \\non more milk than they want  \\nduring a feed. Remember, every \\nbaby is different. Some prefer  \\nto feed little and often. \\nConstipation\\nAlways \\nstick to the \\nrecommended \\namount of infant \\nformula milk powder. \\nUsing too much can make your \\nbaby constipated or thirsty. \\nBreastfed babies don’t usually \\nget constipated. If your baby is \\nunder eight weeks old and has not \\npassed a stool for a few days, talk \\nto your health visitor or GP . \\nWater\\nIn very hot weather, babies fed on \\ninfant formula milk can get thirsty. \\nIf this happens, you can give them \\ncool boiled tap water if they seem \\nunsettled between feeds. Talk to \\nyour health visitor or GP if you \\nhave any concerns. \\nBreastfed babies do not need any \\nwater. Instead, you may notice that \\nthey have shorter, more frequent \\nfeeds if the weather is hotter.\\nCoping with allergies \\nIf you think your baby might be \\nallergic to formula milk, talk to  \\nyour GP . They can prescribe formula \\nfeeds called extensively hydrolysed \\nprotein feeds. \\nSome formulas are labelled as \\nhypoallergenic, but they are not \\nsuitable for babies with a diagnosed \\ncows’ milk allergy. Talk to your GP \\nbefore using this milk. Always get \\ntheir advice before using soya-based \\ninfant formulas, too. Babies who  \\nare allergic to cows’ milk may also \\nbe allergic to soya. \\nBabies sometimes grow out of \\nallergies, and you may ﬁnd that  \\nyou can introduce cows’ milk into \\nyour baby’s diet as they get older. \\nAlways ask your GP or health  \\nvisitor for advice before making  \\nany changes to your baby’s diet.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pregnancy.pdf', 'page': 141}, page_content='SLEEP \\nThe amount that babies sleep, even \\nwhen they are very small, varies a \\nlot. During the early weeks some \\nbabies sleep for most of the time \\nbetween feeds. Others will be \\nwide awake. As they grow older, \\nthey begin to develop a pattern of \\nwaking and sleeping. Some babies \\nneed more sleep than others and at \\ndifferent times. Try not to compare \\nwhat your baby does with other \\npeople’s babies. All babies are \\ndifferent, and their routines will \\nchange as they grow.\\nYou will gradually begin to \\nrecognise when your baby is ready \\nfor sleep and is likely to settle. Some \\nbabies settle better after a warm \\nbath. Most sleep after a good feed.  \\nA baby who wants to sleep is not \\nlikely to be disturbed by ordinary \\nhousehold noises, so there is no \\nneed to keep your whole home \\nquiet while your baby sleeps. It will \\nhelp you if your baby gets used to \\nsleeping through a certain amount of \\nnoise. See the column on the right \\nfor advice on sleeping positions.\\nTwins, triplets or more can have \\nspeciﬁc sleeping issues and it may \\nbe difﬁcult for you to get them \\ninto a routine. The Multiple Births \\nFoundation and Tamba (see pages \\n183 and 188) have information  \\nthat you may ﬁnd useful. They can \\nsleep in the same cot – there is \\ninformation from Tamba on  \\nhow you can do this safely.\\nReducing the risk  \\n of cot death\\nSadly, we don’t know why some \\nbabies die suddenly and for no \\napparent reason from what is \\ncalled ‘cot death’ or ‘Sudden \\nInfant Death Syndrome’ (SIDS). \\nBut we do know that placing \\na baby to sleep on their back \\nreduces the risk, and that \\nexposing a baby to cigarette \\nsmoke or overheating a baby \\nincreases the risk.\\nAll the advice that we now \\nhave for reducing the risk of cot \\ndeath and other dangers, such \\nas suffocation, is listed on this \\npage and opposite. Remember \\nthat cot death is rare, so don’t \\nlet worrying about it stop you \\nenjoying your baby’s ﬁrst few \\nmonths. But do follow the advice \\ngiven here to reduce the risks as \\nmuch as possible.\\nTo reduce the risk of cot death:\\n•  Place your baby on their back \\nto sleep, in a cot in a room \\nwith you.\\n•  Do not smoke in pregnancy or \\nlet anyone smoke in the same \\nroom as your baby.\\n•  Do not share a bed with your \\nbaby if you have been drinking \\nalcohol, if you take drugs or if \\nyou are a smoker.\\n•  Never sleep with your baby on \\na sofa or armchair.\\n•  Do not let your baby get too \\nhot – keep your baby’s head \\nuncovered.\\n•  Place your baby in the ‘feet to \\nfoot’ position.\\nThe safest place for your  \\nbaby to sleep is on their \\nback in a cot in a room  \\nwith you for the ﬁrst  \\nsix months.\\n140\\nPlace your baby on their \\nback to sleep\\nPlace your baby on their back to \\nsleep from the very beginning for \\nboth day and night sleeps. This will \\nreduce the risk of cot death. Side \\nsleeping is not as safe as sleeping \\non the back. Healthy babies placed \\non their backs are not more likely \\nto choke. When your baby is old \\nenough to roll over, they should not \\nbe prevented from doing so.\\nBabies may get ﬂattening of \\nthe part of the head they lie on \\n(plagiocephaly). This will become \\nrounder again as they grow, \\nparticularly if they are encouraged \\nto lie on their tummies to play \\nwhen they are awake and being \\nsupervised. Experiencing a range of \\ndifferent positions and a variety of \\nmovement while awake is also good \\nfor a baby’s development.\\nThe risks of bed sharing\\nThe safest place for your baby to \\nsleep is in a cot in a room with you \\nfor the ﬁrst six months. Do not \\nshare a bed with your baby if you or \\nyour partner:\\n•  are smokers (no matter where or \\nwhen you smoke and even if you \\nnever smoke in bed)\\n•  have recently drunk alcohol\\n•  have taken medication or drugs \\nthat make you sleep more heavily\\n•  feel very tired.\\nThe risks of bed sharing are also \\nincreased if your baby:\\n•  was premature (born before \\n37 weeks), or\\n•  was of low birth weight \\n(less than 2.5kg or 5.5lb).\\nThere is also a risk that you might \\nroll over in your sleep and suffocate \\nyour baby, or that your baby could \\nget caught between the wall and \\nthe bed, or could roll out of an adult \\nbed and be injured.'),\n",

Or you can just leave \\nthe skin clean and dry, especially  \\nwith disposable nappies, since cream  \\nmay prevent them absorbing urine \\nso well. Don’t use baby powder  \\nas it can cause choking.\\n• If you are using a cloth nappy, \\nplace it in a waterproof cover (if \\nneeded) and put a nappy liner \\ninside.

Many \\nearly miscarriages (before 14 weeks) \\nhappen because there is something \\nwrong with the development of the \\nbaby. There can be other causes, \\nsuch as hormone or blood-clotting \\nproblems. A later miscarriage may \\nbe due to an infection, problems \\nin the placenta, or the cervix being \\nweak and opening too early in  \\nthe pregnancy.\\nA miscarriage in the ﬁrst few weeks \\nmay start like a period, with spotting \\nor bleeding and mild cramps or \\nbackache. The pain and bleeding \\nmay get worse and there can be \\nheavy bleeding, blood clots and quite \\nsevere cramping pains. With a later \\nmiscarriage, you may go through an \\nearly labour. If you bleed or begin to \\nhave pains at any stage of pregnancy, \\nyou should contact your GP or \\nmidwife. You could also contact your \\nlocal early pregnancy unit (though \\nthey may want a referral from your \\nGP before they see you). If you \\nare more than six or seven weeks \\npregnant, you may be referred for an \\nultrasound scan to see if your baby \\nhas a heartbeat and is developing \\nnormally. Sometimes the bleeding \\nstops by itself and your pregnancy \\nwill carry on quite normally. \\nSome women ﬁnd out that their \\nbaby has died only when they have \\na routine scan. If they have had no \\npain or bleeding, this can come as \\na terrible shock, especially if the \\nscan shows that the baby died days \\nor weeks before. This is sometimes \\ncalled a missed or silent miscarriage.\\nTreatment for \\nmiscarriage\\nSometimes it is preferable to wait \\nand let the miscarriage happen \\nnaturally, but there are three ways \\nof actively managing a miscarriage: \\n•\\x00Medicine. You may be offered \\ntablets or pessaries to start the \\nprocess of miscarriage. \\n•\\x00Operation.

Symptoms include nausea  \\nor feeling sick, as well as actually being sick. Morning sickness can occur at any time of the day, \\nthough it occurs most often in the morning because blood sugar levels are low after a night \\nwithout food.

This can cause problems in second or later pregnancies. If she \\ngets pregnant with another rhesus positive baby, the immune response will be quicker and \\nmuch greater. The antibodies produced by the mother can cross the placenta and attach to the \\nD antigen on her baby’s red blood cells. This can be harmful to the baby as it may result in a \\ncondition called haemolytic disease of the newborn, which can lead to anaemia and jaundice.\\nRhesus negative People with a certain blood type are known as rhesus negative. It means that they do not \\nhave a substance known as D antigen on the surface of their red blood cells.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\textbook.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='This widely acclaimed Dutta\\'s Textbook of Gynecology  has stepped into its sixth edition within a span \\nof twenty three years. Since its predecessor, each area of gynecology has evolved substantially due to the \\nconcurrent progress in the field of molecular biology, technology and imaging. The amount of knowledge \\nto acquire and skill to develop by the students, residents and clinicians are enormous. Retaining the basic \\nobjectives of Dutta, for his textbook, this edition has been revised extensively in the light of current wealth of \\ninformation and for the need of our targeted readers. Each chapter of this book is authoritative. Consistency \\nand uniformity with updated information in all the chapters is a special feature of this text.\\nThis edition has been made more user-friendly in terms of presentation of text matters, graphics, design \\nand use of different color codes. Color code helps to highlight the core knowledge (must-know area) and also \\nto present the high quality photographs, anatomical drawings, and imaging studies. The text has been enriched \\nwith tables, diagrams, boxes, charts, and algorithms which could be reproduced easily. Key points at the end \\nof each chapter are for quick and easy revision. The state-of-the art in Dutta\\'s text lies in the presentation \\nwhich is simple, lucid, clear, and concise. Above all, it provides a balanced distillation of evidence-based \\ninformation upon which a student, trainee resident, a practitioner, and a nurse can fully depend.\\nChapters on basic areas (chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 9), reproductive endocrinology (chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 28, \\n31, 33), menopause (chapter 6), diagnostic and imaging technologies (chapter 9), pelvic infections (chapters \\n10, 11, 12), oncology (chapters 22, 23, 30), urogynecology (chapters 24 and 25), contraception (chapter \\n29) have either been thoroughly revised or exhaustively rewritten. New topics, for example, adolescent \\ngynecology (chapter 32), sexual dysfunction (chapter 33), gene therapy (chapter 30) have been incorporated. \\nChapters in general gynecology 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 have been extensively updated. The chapter on pelvic \\norgan prolapse (chapter 15) has been rewritten, based upon the latest concept of pelvic anatomy and the ‘new\\' \\nconcepts of repair. Operative gynecology (chapter 34) is meant to provide the basic principles of commonly \\nperformed gynecologic surgery so as to guide an apprentice. More emphasis has been given on case selection \\n(indications), principal steps of operation and the complications. The chapter on endoscopic (laparoscopic \\nand hysteroscopic) surgery (Chapter 35) has been rewritten, as it has gained its place to a large extent.\\nThe chapter on practical gynecology (chapter 37) consists of several hundreds of questions along with \\nanswers, explanations and high quality photographs and plates of imaging studies. This chapter is designed to \\nhelp the students in their preparations for the clinical and oral parts of the examination. The self-assessment \\nquestionnaire having objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) format is to improve the clinical \\ncompetence of the students. The total information given in chapter 37 amounts to a \"mini-textbook-cum-color \\natlas\" of gynecology.\\nMore than 470 figures, photographs, sketches and drawings have been incorporated.\\nConsidering the vast amount of scientific information and the progressive research, it is practically \\nimpossible to limit the subject matter within the few pages of this book. Arrangements have been made, \\nthrough electronic media (website, e-mails) for the readers who wish to know more [highlighted in the text \\n\\'more information\\'; \\'ask the author\\' ]. Informations regarding examination situation (theory, viva-voce and \\nmultiple choice questions and answers, clinical examination procedures, operation video clips) have been \\nprovided through these electronic resources (www.dcdutta.com/www.hiralalkonar.com).\\nMy aim in this book has always been to help the students, residents, and the clinicians to remain with \\nupdated the knowledge that has passed the test of clinical relevancy.\\nPreface to the sixth edition'),\n",

I have consulted \\nmany outstanding teachers in the profession, a multitude of eminent authors and many current evidence-L \\nstudies-the legacy is gratefully acknowledged.

Initially, I was hesitant to proceed with the stupendous task but considering the fact that \\na compact, comprehensive and practical-oriented fundamental book in gynecology is not available to the \\nundergraduates, I have decided to comply with their request.\\nThe book has been written in a lucid language in author\\'s own style. Extensive diagrams, photographs, and \\nflow-charts (schemes) have been depicted throughout the text to give clarity of the subject. Due attention has \\nbeen paid to project the fundamental principles and practice of gynecology. As such, more emphasis has been \\ngiven on medical gynecology. But for that, indications, limitations, and principles of techniques of operations \\nhave received adequate consideration. The book is thus made invaluable not only to the medical students but \\nalso the practising physicians and students of nursing.\\nThe author wishes to acknowledge gratitude to his esteemed colleague Dr N Chowdhury, MBBS, DGO, \\nMO (Cal), for his contribution to the topic \"Hormone Therapy in Gynecological practice\". Dr Santosh Kr. \\nPaul, MBBS, DGO, MO(Cal), Prof Dept of Obst and Gyne, NRS Medical College, Calcutta, deserves full \\nappreciation for his contribution in a lucid way to the topic \"Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy in Gynecology\". \\nThe author has much pleasure in expressing grateful thanks to Dr B N Chakrabarty, MBBS, DGO, MO(Cal), \\nFRCOG (Eng) and Dr K M Gun, MBBS, DGO, MO (Cal), FRCOG (Eng), FRCS (Edin), FACS (USA), \\nfor their valued suggestions as and when required and their contribution of photographs to enrich the text. \\nI gratefully record my thanks to Dr Subir Kumar Dutta, MBBS, DCP, MD (Path & Bact), Prof, Dept of \\nPathology and Bacteriology, University College of Medicine, Calcutta, for the microphotographs depicted \\nthroughout the text. The author records his thanks to Dr SM Dali, Prof of Obst and Gyne and Dr Bhola Rijal, \\nAssociate Prof of Obst and Gyne of Teaching Hospital and Dr (Mrs) Dibya S Malia, Director, Maternity \\nHospital, Kathmandu, Nepal, for their contribution of few outstanding photographs to enrich the text.\\nThe author expressed much pleasure all the time to the House Surgeons, Internees and students of Nilratan \\nSircar Medical College, Calcutta, for the help they have rendered in preparation of the final drafts of the \\nmanuscripts, check up of the proofs and compiling the index. Their help is invaluable and unforgettable and \\nwithout which the book could never have been published.\\nThe author wishes to thank Mr Biren Das for his exhaustive number of drawings and flow-charts which \\nenrich the lucidity of the book. The author also thanks Mr Ranjit Sen for preparation of photographs (black \\nand white) depicted throughout the text.

These are all visible on external \\nexamination. It is, therefore, bounded anteriorly by \\nthe mons veneris, laterally by the labia majora and \\nposteriorly by the perineum (Fig. 1.1).\\nmONS VENERIS (m ONS puBIS)\\nIt is the pad of subcutaneous adipose connective tissue \\nlying in front of the pubis and, in the adult female, is \\ncovered by hair.\\nLABIA mAJORA\\nThe vulva is bounded on each side by the elevation \\nof skin and subcutaneous tissue, which form the labia \\nmajora. They are continuous where they join medially \\nto form the posterior commissure in front of the anus. \\nThe inner surface of the labia majora are hairless. The \\nlabia majora are covered with squamous epithelium \\nand contain sebaceous glands, sweat glands and hair \\nfollicles. Beneath the skin, there are dense connective \\ntissue and adipose tissue. The adipose tissue is richly \\nsupplied by venous plexus, which may produce \\nhematoma, if injured during childbirth. The labia \\nmajora are homologous with the scrotum in the \\nmale. The round ligaments terminate at its anterior third.\\nLABIA mINORA\\nLabia minora are two thick folds of skin, devoid \\nof fat, on either side just within the labia majora. \\nExcept in the parous women, they are only exposed \\nwhen the labia majora are separated. Anteriorly, they \\nare divided to enclose the clitoris and unite with \\neach other in front and behind the clitoris to form \\nthe prepuce and frenulum, respectively. The lower \\nportion of the labia minora fuses across the midline to \\nform a fold of skin known as fourchette. It is usually \\ninjured during childbirth. Between the fourchette \\nand the vaginal orifice is the fossa navicularis. \\nThe labia minora do not contain hair follicle. The \\nfolds contain connective tissues, numerous sebaceous \\nglands, erectile muscle fibers and numerous vessels \\nand nerve endings. It is homologous to the ventral \\naspect of the penis.\\nCLITORIS\\nClitoris is a small cylindrical erectile body, measuring \\nabout 2.5 cm situated in the most anterior part of the \\nvulva. It consists of glans, a body and two crura. The \\nglans is covered by squamous epithelium and is richly \\nsupplied with nerves. The vessels of the clitoris are \\nconnected with the vestibular bulb and are liable to \\nbe injured during childbirth. Clitoris is an analogue \\nto the penis in the male, but it differs basically in \\nbeing entirely separate from the urethra. It is attached \\nto the undersurface of the symphysis pubis by the \\nsuspensory ligament.\\nVESTIBu LE\\nVestibule is a triangular space bounded anteriorly by \\nthe clitoris, posteriorly by the fourchette and on either \\nside by labium minus. There are four openings into \\nthe vestibule (Fig. 1.1).\\nuRETh RAL OpENING\\nThe opening is situated in the midline, just in front \\nof the vaginal orifice about 1–1.5 cm below the \\nCh-01.indd   1 13-11-2013   09:42:25'),\n",

In \\nvirgins and nulliparae, the opening is closed by \\nthe labia minora but in parous, it may be exposed. \\nIt is incompletely closed by a septum of mucous \\nmembrane, called hymen. The membrane varies in \\nshape but is usually circular or crescentic in virgins. \\nThe hymen is usually ruptured at the consummation of \\nmarriage. During childbirth, the hymen is extremely \\nlacerated and is later represented by cicatrized nodules \\nof varying sizes, called the carunculae myrtiformes. \\nOn both sides, it is lined by stratified squamous \\nepithelium.\\nBARThOLIN’S GLANd\\nThe Bartholin’ s glands are situated in the \\nsuperficial perineal pouch,  close to the posterior \\nend of the vestibular bulb. They are pea-sized, of \\nabout 0.5 cm and yellowish-white in color. During \\nsexual excitement, it secretes abundant alkaline \\nmucus which helps in lubrication. Contraction of \\nbulbocavernosus helps squeeze the secretion. The \\nglands are compound racemose variety and are \\nlined by columnar epithelium. Each gland has got \\na duct which measures about 2 cm and opens into \\nfig. 1.1: The virginal vulva\\nfig. 1.2: Mucous lining of Bartholin’s duct\\nCh-01.indd   2 13-11-2013   09:42:25'),\n",

There are four fornices—one \\nanterior, one posterior, and two lateral; the posterior \\none being deeper and the anterior, most shallow one.\\nRelations\\nAnterior\\nThe upper one-third is related with base of the bladder \\nand the lower two-thirds are with the urethra, the \\nlower half of which is firmly embedded with its wall \\n(Fig. 1.4).\\nPosterior\\nThe upper one-third is related with the pouch of Douglas, \\nthe middle-third with the anterior rectal wall separated \\nby rectovaginal septum, and the lower-third is separated \\nfrom the anal canal by the perineal body (Fig. 1.5).\\nLateral walls\\nThe upper one-third is related with the pelvic cellular \\ntissue at the base of broad ligament in which the \\nureter and the uterine artery lie approximately 2 cm \\nfrom the lateral fornices. The middle-third is blended \\nwith the levator ani and the lower-third is related with \\nthe bulbocavernosus muscles, vestibular bulbs, and \\nBartholin’s glands (Fig. 1.6).\\nStructures\\nLayers from within outwards are\\n(1) mucous coat which is lined by stratified \\nsquamous epithelium without any secreting glands; \\n(2) submucous layer of loose areolar vascular tissues; \\n(3) muscular layer consisting of indistinct inner \\ncircular and outer longitudinal and; (4) fibrous coat \\nderived from the endopelvic fascia which is tough and \\nhighly vascular (Fig. 1.7).\\nEpithelium\\nThe vaginal epithelium is under the action of sex \\nhormones (Fig. 1.8). At birth and up to 10–14 \\ndays, the epithelium is stratified squamous under \\nthe influence of maternal estrogen circulating in \\nthe newborn. Thereafter, up to prepuberty and \\nin postmenopause, the epithelium becomes thin, \\nconsisting of few layers only.\\nFrom puberty till menopause,  the vaginal epi-\\nthelium is stratified squamous and devoid of any \\ngland. Three distinct layers are defined—basal cells, \\nintermediate cells, and superficial cornified cells.

Normally, \\nit may be little excess in mid-menstrual or just prior \\nto menstruation, during pregnancy and during sexual \\nexcitement.

Conversion of glycogen \\nin the exfoliated squamous cells to lactic acid by the \\nDoderlein’s bacilli is dependent on estrogen. As \\nsuch, the pH is more towards acidic during child-\\nbearing period and ranges between 4 and 5.5 with \\naverage of 4.5. The pH is highest in upper vagina \\nbecause of contaminated cervical secretion (alkaline). \\nThe vaginal secretion consists  of tissue fluid, \\nepithelial debris, some leukocytes (never contains \\nmore than an occasional pus cell), electrolytes, \\nproteins, and lactic acid (in a concentration of 0.75%). \\nApart from Doderlein’s bacilli, it contains many \\na pathogenic organism including Cl. welchii. The \\nglycogen content is highest in the vaginal fornix to \\nthe extent of 2.5–3 mg% and is lowest in the lower-\\nthird being 0.6–0.9 mg%.\\nDoderlein’s bacillus: It is a rod-shaped gram- positive \\nbacillus which grows anaerobically on acid media. \\nIt appears in the vagina 3–4 days after birth and \\ndisappears after 10–14 days. It appears again at puberty \\nand disappears after menopause. It probably comes \\nfrom the intestine. Its presence is dependent to estrogen, \\nand its function is to convert the glycogen present in the \\nvaginal mucosa into lactic acid so that the vaginal pH is \\nmaintained towards acidic side. This acid pH prevents \\ngrowth of the other pathogenic organisms (Fig. 1.8).\\nBlood Supply\\nThe arteries involved are: (1) cervicovaginal branch \\nof the uterine artery, (2) vaginal artery—a branch of \\nanterior division of internal iliac or in common origin \\nwith the uterine, (3) middle rectal, and (4) internal \\npudendal. These anastomose with one another and \\nform two azygos arteries—anterior and posterior.\\nVeins drain into internal iliac and internal pudendal \\nveins.\\nNerve Supply: The vagina is supplied by sym-\\npathetic and parasympathetic from the pelvic plexus. \\nThe lower part is supplied by the pudendal nerve.\\nThE uTERuS\\nThe uterus is a hollow pyriform muscular organ \\nsituated in the pelvis between the bladder in front and \\nthe rectum behind (Fig. 1.5).\\nposition: Its normal position is one of the anteversion\\nand anteflexion. The uterus usually inclines to the \\nright (dextrorotation) so that the cervix is directed \\nto the left (levorotation) and comes in close relation \\nwith the left ureter.\\nmeasurements and parts: The uterus measures about \\n8 cm long, 5 cm wide at the fundus and its walls are \\nabout 1.25 cm thick. Its weight varies from 50–80 g. It \\nhas got the following parts (Fig. 1.9).\\n• Body or corpus • Isthmus • Cervix\\nBody or corpus: The body is further divided into \\nfundus—the part which lies above the openings of \\nthe uterine tubes. The body properly is triangular and \\nlies between the openings of the tubes and the isthmus. \\nThe superolateral angles of the body of the uterus \\nproject outwards from the junction of the fundus and \\nbody and are called the cornua of the uterus. The \\nuterine tube, round ligament, and ligament of the \\novary are attached to each cornu.\\nIsthmus: The isthmus is a constricted part measuring \\nabout 0.5 cm situated between the body and the cervix. \\nIt is limited above by the anatomical internal os and \\nbelow by the histological internal os (Aschoff). Some \\nconsider isthmus as a part of the lower portion of the \\nbody of the uterus.\\nCervix: The cervix is the lowermost part of the \\nuterus. It extends from the histological internal os \\nand ends at external os which opens into the vagina \\nafter perforating the anterior vaginal wall. It is almost \\ncylindrical in shape and measures about 2.5 cm in \\nlength and diameter. It is divided into a supravaginal \\npart—the part lying above the vagina and a vaginal \\nfig. 1.9: Coronal section showing different  \\nparts of uterus\\nCh-01.indd   7 13-11-2013   09:42:26'),\n",

In  nulliparous , the vaginal part of the \\ncervix is conical with the external os looking circular, \\nwhereas in parous, it is cylindrical with the external \\nos having bilateral slits. The slit is due to invariable \\ntear of the circular muscles surrounding the external \\nos and gives rise to anterior and posterior lips of the \\ncervix.\\nCavity: The cavity of the uterine body is triangular \\non coronal section with the base above and the apex \\nbelow. It measures about 3.5 cm. There is no cavity \\nin the fundus. The cervical canal is fusiform and \\nmeasures about 2.5 cm. Thus, the normal length of the \\nuterine cavity including the cervical canal is usually \\n6–7 cm (Fig. 1.9).\\nRelations \\nAnteriorly: Above the internal os, the body forms the \\nposterior wall of the uterovesical pouch. Below the \\ninternal os, it is separated from the base of the bladder \\nby loose areolar tissue.\\nPosteriorly: It is covered by peritoneum and forms \\nthe anterior wall of the pouch of Douglas containing \\ncoils of intestine.\\nLaterally:  The double folds of peritoneum of the \\nbroad ligament are attached laterally between which \\nthe uterine artery ascends up. Attachment of the \\nMackenrodt’s ligament extends from the internal os \\ndown to the supravaginal cervix and lateral vaginal \\nwall. About 1.5 cm away at the level of internal os, \\na little nearer on the left side is the crossing of the \\nuterine artery and the ureter. The uterine artery \\ncrosses from above and in front of the ureter, soon \\nbefore the ureter enters the ureteric tunnel (Fig. 1.10).\\nStructures\\nBody—The wall consists of 3 layers from outside \\ninwards: \\n ♦ Perimetrium—It is the serous coat which invests \\nthe entire organ except on the lateral borders. \\nThe peritoneum is intimately adherent to the \\nunderlying muscles.\\n ♦ Myometrium— It consists of thick bundles of \\nsmooth muscle fibers held by connective tissues \\nand are arranged in various directions. During \\npregnancy, however, three distinct layers can be \\nidentified—outer longitudinal, middle interlacing \\nand the inner circular.\\n ♦ Endometrium—The mucous lining of the cavity \\nis called endometrium. As there is no submucous \\nlayer, the endometrium is directly apposed to the \\nmuscle coat. It consists of lamina propria and \\nsurface epithelium. The surface epithelium is a \\nsingle layer of ciliated columnar epithelium. The \\nlamina propria contains stromal cells, endometrial \\nglands, vessels and nerves. The glands are simple \\ntubular and lined by mucus secreting non-ciliated \\ncolumnar epithelium which penetrate the stroma \\nand sometimes even enter the muscle coat. All \\nthe components are changed during menstrual \\ncycles (see Ch. 8). The endometrium is changed \\nto decidua during pregnancy.\\nCERVIX: The cervix is composed mainly of fibrous \\nconnective tissues. The smooth muscle fibers average \\n10–15%. Only the posterior surface has got peritoneal \\ncoat (see Fig. 1.5).\\nEpithelial Lining of the cervix\\nEndocervical canal and glands\\nThere is a median ridge on both the anterior and \\nposterior surface of the canal from which transverse \\nfolds radiate. This arrangement is called arbor \\nvitae uteri. The canal is lined by single layer of tall \\ncolumnar epithelium with basal nuclei. Those placed \\nfig. 1.10: The relation of the ureter to the uterine artery\\nCh-01.indd   8 13-11-2013   09:42:26'),\n",

There are \\npatches of cubical basal or reserve cells underneath \\nthe columnar epithelium. These cells may undergo \\nsquamous metaplasia or may replace the superficial \\ncells (see p. 321).\\nThe glands which dip into the stroma are of \\ncomplex racemose type and are lined by secretory \\ncolumnar epithelium. There is no stroma unlike \\nthe corpus and the lining epithelium rests on a thin \\nbasement membrane. The change in the epithelium \\nand the glands during menstrual cycle and pregnancy \\nare not so much as those in the endometrium.\\nPortio vaginalis\\nIt is covered by stratified squamous epithelium and \\nextends right up to the external os where there is \\nabrupt change to columnar type. \\nThe transitional zone (transformation zone)\\nmay be of 1–10 mm width with variable histological \\nfeatures. The zone consists of endocervical stroma \\nand glands covered by squamous epithelium. The \\nzone is not static but changes with hormone level \\nof estrogen. The site is constantly irritated not only \\nby hormones but also by infection and trauma. Thus, \\nthere is more chance of severe dysplasia, carcinoma \\nin situ or even invasive carcinoma at this zone (Fig. \\n1.11) (see p. 322).\\nSecretion: The endometrial secretion is scanty and \\nwatery. The physical and chemical properties of \\nthe cervical secretion change with menstrual cycles \\nand with pregnancy. The cervical glands secrete an \\nalkaline mucus with pH 7.8. The mucus is rich in \\nfructose, glycoprotein and mucopolysaccharides. \\nIt also contains sodium chloride. The fructose has \\ngot nutritive function to the spermatozoa. Under \\nestrogenic stimulation, glycoprotein network is \\narranged parallel to each other thus facilitating sperm \\nascent. Progesterone produces interlacing bridges \\nthereby preventing sperm penetration. Cervical \\nmucus contributes significantly to the normal vaginal \\ndischarge. A part forms the mucus plug which \\nfunctionally closes the cervical canal and has got \\nbacteriolytic property.\\nPelvic peritoneum in relation to the uterus\\nThis is described later in the chapter.\\nBlood Supply\\nArterial supply: The arterial supply is from the \\nuterine artery—one on each side. The artery arises \\ndirectly from the anterior division of the internal iliac \\nor in common with superior vesical artery. The other \\nsources are ovarian and vaginal arteries to which \\nthe uterine arteries anastomose. The uterine artery \\ncrosses the ureter anteriorly about 1.5 cm away \\nfig. 1.11: Character of the lining epithelium of the cervix\\nCh-01.indd   9 13-11-2013   09:42:27'),\n",

The internal supply of the uterus \\nis shown in Figure 2.1.\\nVeins: The venous channels correspond to the arterial \\ncourse and drain into internal iliac veins.\\nNerve Supply\\nThe nerve supply of the uterus is derived principally \\nfrom the sympathetic system and partly from the \\nparasympathetic system. Sympathetic components \\nare from T5 and T 6 (motor) and T 10 to L 1 spinal \\nsegments (sensory). The somatic distribution of \\nuterine pain is that area of the abdomen supplied by \\nT10 to L1. The parasympathetic system is represented \\non either side by the pelvic nerve which consists of \\nboth motor and sensory fibers from S2, S3, S4 and ends \\nin the ganglia of Frankenhauser which lies on either \\nsides of the cervix.\\nThe cervix is insensitive to touch, heat and also \\nwhen it is grasped by any instrument. The uterus, too \\nis insensitive to handling and even to incision over \\nits wall.\\nChanges of uterus with Age\\nAt birth, the uterus lies in the false pelvis; the cervix \\nis much longer than the body. In childhood,  the \\nproportion is maintained but reduced to 2:1. At \\npuberty, the body is growing faster under the action \\nof ovarian steroids (estrogens) and the proportion is \\nreversed to 1:2 and following childbirth, it becomes \\neven 1:3. After menopause the uterus atrophies; the \\noverall length is reduced; the walls become thinner, \\nless muscular but more fibrous (Fig. 5.1).\\nposition of the uterus\\nThe normal position of the uterus is anteversion and \\nanteflexion. Anteversion relates the long axis of the \\ncervix to the long axis of vagina which is about 90°. \\nAnteflexion relates the long axis of the body to the \\nlong axis of the cervix and is about 120°. In about \\n15–20%, normally the uterus remains in retroverted \\nposition. In erect posture, the internal os lies on the \\nupper border of the symphysis pubis and the external \\nos lies at the level of ischial spines.\\nfALLOpIAN TuBE (SyN: uTERINE  TuBE)\\nThe uterine tubes are paired structures, measuring \\nabout 10 cm (4\") and are situated in the medial three-\\nfourth of the upper free margin of the broad ligaments. \\nEach tube has got two openings, one communicating \\nwith the lateral angle of the uterine cavity, called \\nuterine opening and measures 1 mm in diameter, the \\nother is on the lateral end of the tube, called pelvic \\nopening or abdominal ostium and measures about 2 \\nmm in diameter (Fig. 1.12).\\nparts: There are four parts, from medial to lateral, \\nthey are—(1) intramural or interstitial lying in the \\nuterine wall and measures 1.25 cm (1/2\") in length \\nand 1 mm in diameter; (2) isthmus almost straight and \\nfig. 1.12: Half of uterine cavity and Fallopian tube of one side are cut open to show different parts of the tube.

The abdominal \\nostium is surrounded by a number of radiating \\nfimbriae, one of these is longer than the rest and is \\nattached to the outer pole of the ovary called ovarian \\nfimbria (Fig. 1.13).\\nStructures—It consists of 3 layers:\\n1. Serous—consists of peritoneum on all sides except \\nalong the line of attachment of mesosalpinx.\\n2. Muscular —arranged in two layers—outer \\nlongitudinal and inner circular.\\n3. Mucous membrane is thrown into longitudinal folds. \\nIt is lined by columnar epithelium, partly ciliated, \\nothers secretory nonciliated and ‘Peg cells’. The \\nepithelium rests on delicate vascular reticulum of \\nconnective tissue. There is no submucous layer nor \\nany glands. Changes occur in the tubal epithelium \\nduring menstrual cycle but are less pronounced and \\nthere is no shedding (Fig. 1.13).\\nfunctions: The important functions of the tubes are—\\n(1) transport of gametes, (2) to facilitate fertilization, \\nand (3) survival of zygote through its secretion.\\nBlood supply: Arterial supply is from the uterine and \\novarian. Venous drainage is through the pampiniform \\nplexus into the ovarian veins.\\nNerve supply: The nerve supply is derived from the \\nuterine and ovarian nerves. The tube is very much \\nsensitive to handling.\\nThE OVARy\\nThe ovaries are paired sex glands or gonads in female \\nwhich are concerned with:\\ni.  Germ cell maturation, storage and its release.\\nii. Steroidogenesis.\\nEach gland is oval in shape and pinkish grey \\nin color and the surface is scarred during repro-\\nductive period. It measures about 3 cm in length, \\n2 cm in breadth and 1 cm in thickness. Each ovary \\npresents two ends—tubal and uterine, two borders—\\nmesovarium and free posterior and two surfaces—\\nmedial and lateral.\\nThe ovaries are intraperitoneal structures. In \\nnulliparae, the ovary lies in the ovarian fossa on \\nthe lateral pelvic wall. The ovary is attached to \\nthe posterior layer of the broad ligament by the \\nmesovarium, to the lateral pelvic wall by infun-\\ndibulopelvic ligament and to the uterus by the ovarian \\nligament.\\nRelations: Mesovarium or anterior border—A fold \\nof peritoneum from the posterior leaf of the broad \\nligament is attached to the anterior border through \\nwhich the ovarian vessels and nerves enter the hilum \\nof the gland.

Lateral \\nsurface is in contact with the ovarian fossa on the \\nlateral pelvic wall.\\nThe ovarian fossa is related superiorly to the \\nexternal iliac vein, posteriorly to ureter and internal \\niliac vessels and laterally to the peritoneum separat-\\ning the obturator vessels and nerves (Fig. 1.14).\\nStructures: The ovary is covered by a single layer \\nof cubical cell known as germinal epithelium. It is a \\nmisnomer as germ cells are not derived from this layer. \\nThe substance of the gland consists of outer cortex and \\ninner medulla (Fig. 1.15).\\nCortex: It consists of stromal cells which are \\nthickened beneath the germinal epithelium to form \\ntunica albuginea. During reproductive period (i.e. \\nfrom puberty to menopause), the cortex is studded \\nwith numerous follicular structures, called the \\nfunctional units of the ovary in various phases of \\ntheir development. These are related to sex hormone \\nproduction and ovulation. The structures include\\nprimordial follicles, maturing follicles, Graafian \\nfollicles and corpus luteum. Atresia of the structures \\nresults in formation of atretic follicles or corpus \\nalbicans (Fig. 1.15). The structural changes during \\novular cycle are described in the Chapter 8 (see p. 84).\\nMedulla: It consists of loose connective tissues, few \\nunstriped muscles, blood vessels and nerves.

It \\nmeasures about 13 cm in length and has a diameter \\nof 5 mm.\\nCourse and Relations\\nThe ureter enters the pelvis in front of the bifurcation \\nof the common iliac artery over the sacroiliac joint \\nbehind the root of the mesentery on the right side \\nand the apex of the mesosigmoid on the left side. As \\nit courses downwards in contact with the peritoneum, \\nit lies anterior to the internal iliac artery and behind \\nthe ovary and forms the posterior boundary of ovarian \\nfossa (see Fig. 1.14).

The probable causes are: \\npolygenic, multifactorial, teratogens, or environmental. \\nPathology of Müllerian malformation: It may be \\ndue to failure of formation of the vaginal plate or due \\nto its failure of canalization or cavitation. \\nVertical fusion defects result in failure of fusion of \\nthe Müllerian system with urogenital sinus. It may \\nalso be due to incomplete or segmental canalization \\nof the vagina.\\nDisorders of lateral fusion are also due to failure \\nof the two Müllerian ducts to unite. This results in \\ndouble uterovaginal canals. Such malformation may \\nbe obstructive or nonobstructive. \\nTransverse vaginal septa are due to faulty fusion or \\ncanalization of the urogenital sinus and the Müllerian \\nducts. About 45% occur in the upper vagina, 40% \\nin mid vagina and 15% in the lower vagina. Septum \\nlocated in the lower vagina is often complete and the \\nsigns and symptoms are similar to that of imperforate \\nhymen. Ultrasonography is a useful investigation to \\ndetect hematometra, hematocolpos, and also urinary \\ntract malformations. The principles of surgical \\ntreatment are the same. Septum in the upper vagina is \\noften perforated. Incision of a complete (imperforate) \\nseptum becomes easy when the upper vagina is \\ndistended. This reduces the risk of injury to adjacent \\norgans. Otherwise abdominovaginal approach (see \\np. 44) is made. \\nLongitudinal septum of the vagina may be present \\nwhen the distal parts of the Müllerian ducts fail to \\nfuse (fusion failure). It may be associated with double \\nuterus and double cervix. It may be asymptomatic and \\nneeds no treatment. But it may cause dyspareunia or \\nmay obstruct delivery. In such circumstances, the \\nseptum is to be excised. Results of surgery are good \\nin terms of achieving pregnancy. \\nPArtIAL AGEnESIS oF uPPEr  VAGInA \\nA segment of vagina may be atretic in the upper-third. \\nIt is often associated with hypoplasia or even absence \\nof cervix.

Currently, \\nabdominovaginal approach is made to establish \\ncommunication between the uterovaginal canal above \\nand the newly created vagina below. Prosthesis is \\nused to prevent restenosis.

In fact in significant number of cases, \\nthe clinical diagnosis is made during uterine curettage, \\nmanual removal of placenta or cesarean section. For \\nexact diagnosis of the malformation, internal as well as \\nexternal architecture of the uterus must be visualized. \\nFor this reason several investigations in different \\ncombinations are done, such as hysterography (see \\np. 588), hysteroscopy ( see p. 619), laparoscopy \\n(see p. 121), ultrasonography (vaginal probe) (Fig. \\n4.6B) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  \\nUltrasonography and MRI are noninvasive procedures. \\nUrological tract is also evaluated at the same time. \\nThe renal tract abnormality in association with \\nMüllerian abnormality is about 40%. Skeletal \\nsystem anomaly (12%) is also associated. \\nTreatment: Mere presence of any uterine \\nmalformation per se is not an indication of surgical \\nintervention. \\nReproductive outcome: Better obstetric outcome in \\nseptate uterus (86%), bicornuate uterus (50%) has \\nbeen mentioned. Unicornuate uterus has very poor \\n(40%) pregnancy outcome. No treatment is generally \\neffective. Uterus didelphys has best possibility of \\nsuccessful pregnancy (64%).

Success rate \\nof abdominal metroplasty in terms of live birth is \\nhigh (5–75%). \\nHysteroscopic metroplasty is more commonly \\ndone. Resection of the septum can be done either by a \\nresectoscope or by laser (see p. 622).

It is the period of gradual development \\nof secondary sexual characters. There are profound \\nbiological, morphological, and psychological changes \\nthat lead to full sexual maturity and eventually fertility.\\nMorphological changes\\nAs described by Tanner and Marshall, five important \\nphysical changes are evident during puberty. These \\nare breast, pubic and axillary hair growth, growth \\nin height, and menstruation. Most of the changes \\noccur gradually but only the menarche can be dated. \\nMoreover, there is a lot of variations in the timing of \\nthe events. The most common order is beginning \\nof the growth spurt → breast budding (thelarche) \\n→ pubic and axillary hair growth (adrenarche) → \\npeak growth in height → menstruation (menarche). \\nAll these changes are usually completed between the \\nage of 10 and 16 years.\\nImportant controlling factors for onset of puberty \\nare genetic, nutrition, body weight, psychologic state, \\nsocial and cultural background, exposure to light \\nand others. A girl, living in urban areas with good \\nnutrition, adequate body weight and whose mother \\nand sisters have early menarche, starts puberty early. \\nBlind girls start menarche early.\\nENDOCRINOLOGY IN PUBERTY\\nThe levels of gonadal steroids and gonadotropins \\nare low until the age of 6–8 years. This is mainly \\ndue to the negative feedback effect of estrogen to \\nthe hypothalamic pituitary system (Gonadostat). The \\ngonadostat remains very sensitive (6–15 times) to \\nthe negative feedback effect, even though the level \\nof estradiol is very low (10 pg/ml) during that time. \\nAs puberty approaches this negative feedback effect \\nof estrogen is gradually lost (see p. 77). This results \\nin some significant changes in the endocrine function \\nof the girl.\\n ♦ Hypothalamopituitary gonadal axis \\nThe GnRH pulses from hypothalamus results in \\npulsatile gonadotropin secretion (first during the night \\nthen by the day time).\\nGnRH → FSH, lH → Estradiol\\nThe tonic and episodic secretion of gonadotropins \\nin prepubertal period is gradually changed to one of \\ncyclic release in postpubertal period (details in p. 77, \\nFig. 7.6).\\n ♦ Thyroid gland plays an active role in the \\nhypothalamopituitary-gonadal axis.\\n ♦ Adrenal glands (Adrenarche) increase their \\nactivity of sex steroid synthesis (androstenedione, \\nDHA, DHAS) from about 7 years of age. Increased \\nsebum formation, pubic and axillary hair and \\nchange in voice are primarily due to adrenal \\nandrogen production. \\n ♦ Gonadarche: Increased amplitude and frequency \\nof GnRH → ↑ secretion of FSH and lH → ovarian \\nfollicular development →  ↑ estrogen. Gonadal \\nestrogen is responsible for the development of \\nuterus, vagina, vulva and also the breasts (see \\np. 50).\\n ♦ Leptin, a peptide, secreted in the adipose tissue is \\nalso involved in pubertal changes and menarche \\n(see p. 460).\\nCh-05.indd   49 13-11-2013   10:40:46'),\n",

The ratio is 2 : 1 in adult.\\n \\uf086 The term precocious puberty is reserved to those who exhibit any secondary sex characteristic before the age \\nof 8 or menstruate before the age of 10. The common cause being constitutional.\\n The exact etiology of GnRH dependent (true) precocious puberty is not known. Central nervous system disease \\nmay be present in nearly 30% of cases. GnRH independent (pseudo) precocious puberty is mostly related to an \\novarian or adrenal pathology.\\n \\uf086 Life-threatening neoplasms (ovary, adrenal or CNS system) must be ruled out when a girl with precocious \\npuberty is seen.\\n \\uf086 The basic investigations include X-ray hand and wrist for bone age, pelvic sonography, skull X-ray, CT or MRI \\nbrain and electroencephalogram. Serum levels of FSH, LH, hCG, thyroid proﬁ  le, 17 OH progesterone and \\ntestosterone are measured.\\n \\uf086 The primary aim of management for a girl with precocious puberty is to (i) reduce the secretion of gonadotropins. \\n(ii) block the peripheral action of sex steroids and (iii) slow down the growth rate, including skeletal maturation.\\n \\uf086 GnRH agonist is the drug of choice. It suppresses FSH, LH secretion, reverses ovarian cycle, establishes \\namenorrhea, causes regression of breast, pubic hair changes and other secondary sexual characteristics (see p. 53).\\n The other drugs used for constitutional type to suppress the premature activation of hypothalamo-pituitary–\\ngonadal axis are—medroxyprogesterone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and danazol.\\n \\uf086 Delayed puberty is said to occur when the breast tissues and/or pubic hair have not appeared by 13–14 years \\nor menarche as late as 17 years.\\n \\uf086 Ovarian failure and chromosomal anomalies are the common causes of delayed puberty.

It is the point of time when \\nlast and final menstruation occurs. \\nThe clinical diagnosis is confirmed following \\nstoppage of menstruation (amenorrhea) for twelve \\nconsecutive months without any other pathology. As \\nsuch, a woman is declared to have attained menopause \\nonly retrospectively. Premenopause refers to the \\nperiod prior to menopause, postmenopause to the \\nperiod after menopause and perimenopause to the \\nperiod around menopause (40–55 years). \\nClimacteric is the period of time during which \\na woman passes from the reproductive to the non-\\nreproductive stage. This phase covers 5–10 years on \\neither side of menopause.\\nPerimenopause is the part of the climacteric \\nwhen the menstrual cycle is likely to be irregular.\\nPostmenopause is the phase of life that comes \\nafter the menopause.\\nAge of MenoPAuse\\nAge at which menopause occurs is genetically \\npredetermined. The age of menopause is not \\nrelated to age of menarche or age at last pregnancy. \\nIt is also not related to number of pregnancy, \\nlactation, use of oral pill, socioeconomic condition, \\nrace, height or weight. Thinner women have early \\nmenopause. However, cigarette smoking and severe \\nmalnutrition may cause early menopause. The age \\nof menopause ranges between 45–55 years, average \\nbeing 50 years.\\nCliniCAl iMPort AnCe\\nDue to increased life expectancy, specially in affluent \\nsociety, about one-third of life span will be spent \\nduring the period of estrogen deprivation stage with \\nlong-term symptomatic and metabolic complications.\\nenDoCrinology of CliMAC teriC \\nAnD MenoPAuse\\nHypothalamopituitary Gonadal Axis\\nFew years prior to menopause, along with depletion \\nof the ovarian follicles, the follicles become resistant \\nto pituitary gonadotropins. As a result, effective \\nfolliculogenesis is impaired with diminished estradiol \\nproduction. There is a significant fall in the level \\nof serum estradiol from 50–300 pg/mL before \\nmenopause to 10–20 pg/mL after menopause. \\nThis decreases the negative feedback effect on \\nhypothalamopituitary axis resulting in increase in \\nFSH. The increase in FSH is also due to diminished \\ninhibin.  Inhibin, a peptide, is secreted by the \\ngranulosa cells of the ovarian follicle. The increase \\nof LH occurs subsequently. \\nDisturbed folliculogenesis during this period may \\nresult in anovulation, oligo-ovulation, premature \\ncorpus luteum or corpus luteal insufficiency. \\nThe sustained level of estrogens may even cause \\nendometrial hyperplasia and clinical manifestation of \\nmenstrual abnormalities prior to menopause.\\nThe mean cycle length is significantly shorter. This \\nis due to shortening of the follicular phase of the cycle. \\nLuteal phase length remaining constant.\\nUltimately, no more follicles are available and \\neven some exist, they are resistant to gonadotropins. \\nCh-06.indd   57 13-11-2013   10:48:27'),\n",

Serum \\nlevel of estrone (30–70 pg/mL) is higher than that \\nof estradiol (10–20 pg/mL). The major source of \\nestrone is peripheral conversion (aromatization) \\nof androgens from adrenals (mainly) and ovaries. \\nThe aromatization occurs at the level of muscle \\nand adipose tissue. The trace amount of estradiol \\nis derived from peripheral conversion of estrone \\nand androgens. Compared to estradiol, estrone is \\nbiologically less (about one-tenth) potent.\\nWith times, the sources fail to supply the precursors \\nof estrogen and about 5–10 years after menopause, \\nthere is a sharp fall in estrogen and also the trophic \\nhormones. The woman is said to be in a state of true \\nmenopause.\\nAndrogens: After menopause, the stromal cells of \\nthe ovary continue to produce androgens because of \\nincrease in LH. The main androgens are androste-\\nnedione and testosterone. Though the secretion of \\nandrogens from postmenopausal ovary are more,  their \\nperipheral levels are reduced due to conversion of \\nandrogens to estrone in adipose tissue. However, the \\ncumulative effect is a decrease in estrogen: androgen \\nratio. This results in increased facial hair growth and \\nchange in voice.\\nAs the obese patient converts more androgens into \\nestrone, they are less likely to develop symptoms of \\nestrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. But, they are \\nvulnerable to endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial \\ncarcinoma.\\nProgesterone: A trace amount of progesterone \\ndetected is probably adrenal in origin.\\nGonadotropins \\nThe secretions of both FSH and LH are increased \\ndue to absent negative feedback effect of estradiol \\nand inhibin or due to enhanced responsiveness \\nof pituitary to GnRH. Rise in FSH is about 10–20 \\nfold whereas that of LH is about 3-fold. GnRH \\npulse section is increased both in frequency and \\namplitude. During menopause, there is fall in the \\nlevel of prolactin and inhibin. Fall in the level of \\ninhibin (see ch. 7), lead to increase in the level of \\nFSH from the pituitary.

Hot flush is \\ncharacterized by sudden feeling of heat followed by \\nprofuse sweating. There may also be the symptoms \\nof palpitation, fatigue and weakness. The physiologic \\nchanges with hot flushes are perspiration and \\ncutaneous vasodilatation. Both these two functions \\nare under central thermoregulatory control. Low \\nestrogen level is a prerequisite for hot flush. \\nHot flush coincides with GnRH pulse secretion \\nwith increase in serum LH level. It may last for \\n1–10 minutes, and may be at times unbearable. \\nSleep may be disturbed due to night sweats. The \\nthermoregulatory center in association with \\nGnRH center in the hypothalamus is involved in \\nthe etiology of hot flush. Gonadotropins (LH) are \\nthought be involved.\\nGenital and urinary system: Steroid receptors have \\nbeen identified in the mucous membrane of urethra, \\nbladder, vagina and the pelvic floor muscles. Estrogen \\nplays an important role to maintain the epithelium \\nof vagina, urinary bladder and the urethra. Estrogen \\ndeficiency produces atrophic epithelial changes in \\nthese organs. This may cause dyspareunia and dysuria.\\nVagina: Minimal trauma may cause vaginal bleeding. \\nDyspareunia, vaginal infections, dryness, pruritus and \\nleucorrhea are also common. The urinary symptoms \\nare: urgency, dysuria and recurrent urinary tract \\ninfection and stress incontinence.\\nSexual dysfunction: Estrogen deficiency is often \\nassociated with decreased sexual desire. This may be \\ndue psychological changes (depression anxiety) as \\nwell as atrophic changes of the genitourinary system.\\nCh-06.indd   59 13-11-2013   10:48:27'),\n",

However, it is directly connected with the \\nposterior lobe of the pituitary (neurohypophysis) by \\nthe supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (Fig. 7.1).\\nSeCre TiOnS\\nThe hypothalamus produces a series of specific \\nreleasing and inhibiting hormones which have got \\neffect on the production of the specific pituitary \\nhormones. These hormones are synthesized by the \\nhypothalamic neurons and are released at the nerve \\nendings around the tuber cinereum. Thereafter, these \\nare drained to the pituitary through the hypothalamo-\\npituitary portal system of vessels.\\n1. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)\\n The GnRH is also named as luteinizing hormone \\nreleasing hormone (LHRH). GnRH is a \\ndecapeptide and is concerned with the release, \\nsynthesis and storage of both the gonadotropins \\n(FSH and LH) from the anterior pituitary. The \\ndivergent patterns of FSH and LH in response to \\na single GnRH are due to modulating influence of \\nthe endocrine environment specially the feedback \\neffects of steroids on anterior pituitary gland. \\nGnRH is secreted by the arcuate nucleus of the \\nhypothalamus (Fig. 7.1) in a pulsatile fashion. \\nDevelopmentally, these neurons originated from \\nthe olfactory area (see p. 464). The half-life of \\nGnRH is very short (2–4 minutes). This is due to the \\ncleavage of amino acid bonds between 5–6, 6–7 and \\n9–10 in circulation (Fig. 7.1A). GnRH is secreted \\ninto the portal circulation in pulsatile fashion. This \\npulse secretion varies in frequency and amplitude \\nat different phases of menstrual cycle (see \\nbelow). GnRH stimulates anterior pituitary for \\nsynthesis, storage and secretion of gonadotropins. \\nThere is decrease in receptor sensitivity when \\ngonadotroph cells (adenohypophysis) are exposed \\nto GnRH stimulation continually. This is called \\n‘down regulation’. On the contrary, intermittent \\nexposure of GnRH to gonadotrophs, increase the \\nreceptor sensitivity. This is called ‘up-regulation’. \\nThis variable response of anterior pituitary \\ngonadotrophs to GnRH have been utilized in \\ndifferent clinical situation to get therapeutic \\nbenefits (see p. 525).\\n2. Prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) \\n Prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary \\nseems to be under chronic inhibition by PIF. \\nDopamine is the physiological inhibitor.\\n3.

During the \\nentire reproductive period, some 400 are likely to \\novulate. Thus, the important feature is the tendency \\nof the sex cells to undergo degeneration. The \\ndegeneration starts in the intrauterine life and \\ncontinues throughout childhood and the childbearing \\nperiod. As a result, no more follicles with ova can be \\ndetected in menopausal women.\\nmAtURAtion\\nThe essence of maturation is reduction of the number \\nof chromosomes to half. The primary oocyte remains \\nin diplotene phase until shortly before ovulation \\nunless it undergoes atresia. It is the midcycle LH \\nsurge that initiates the resumption of meiosis\\xad1.\\nThe primary oocyte undergoes first meiotic division \\ngiving rise to secondary oocyte and one polar body. \\nThe two are of unequal size, the secondary oocyte \\ncontains haploid number of chromosomes (23, X) but \\nnearly all the cytoplasm. The small polar body also \\ncontains haploid number of chromosome (23, X) but \\nwith scanty cytoplasm. The formation of secondary \\noocyte occurs with full maturation of Graafian follicle \\njust prior to ovulation.\\nThe secondary oocyte immediately begins the \\nsecond meiotic division but stops at metaphase. The \\nsecondary oocyte completes the second meiotic \\ndivision (homotypical) only after fertilization by \\na sperm in the fallopian tube. The division results \\nin the formation of the two unequal daughter cells \\neach possessing 23 chromosomes (23, X). The larger \\none is called the ovum (female pronucleus) and the \\nsmaller one is the second polar body. In the absence \\nof fertilization,  the secondary oocyte , does not \\ncomplete the second meiotic division and degene\\xad\\nrates as such. Thus, the first stage of maturation of the \\noocyte occurs within the follicle but the final stage is \\nachieved only after fertilization in the fallopian tube.\\nThe arrested meiotic division of the oocyte prior \\nto ovulation is probably due to oocyte maturation \\ninhibition (OMI) factor present in the follicular fluid. \\nOMI is secreted by the granulosa cells.

This is in contrast with \\n20 microns and 10 microns, respectively in the \\nprimordial follicle. The radially arranged granulosa \\ncells surrounding the oocyte is called corona radiata. \\nThe oocyte is surrounded by an outer envelope called \\nzona pellucida, a glycoprotein layer, secreted by the \\ngrowing oocyte (Fig 8.1).

The \\nspherical nucleus is located near the center of the \\ncytoplasm. The nucleolus is large with sparsely \\ndistributed chromatin. Shortly before ovulation, \\nmeiosis is reinitiated. At the completion of the first and \\nsecond meiotic division, the number of chromosomes \\nin the oocyte is halved (23, X) and the two polar \\nbodies which are formed are pushed to the perivitelline \\nspace.

The oocyte is now surrounded by an acellular \\nbarrier of glycoprotein produced by the follicular \\ncells and is called zona pellucida. The flattened outer \\nsingle layer pregranulosa cells become cuboidal and \\nmultilayered—now called granulosa cells. There is \\nappearance of channels (gap junctions) between the \\ngranulosa cells and the oocyte. Through these gap \\njunctions nutrition to the oocyte is maintained.

The development of antrum containing \\nsecondary or vesicular follicle from the solid primary \\nfollicle depends on FSH.\\nThere is accelerated growth of all the components of \\nthe follicles of the prentral phase. The granulosa cells \\ngrow faster than the theca cells. There is production \\nof follicular fluid which is primarily an ultrafiltrate of \\nblood from the vessels within theca interna. The fluid-\\nfilled space is formed amidst the granulosa cells. The \\nspaces coalesce to form an antrum.\\nDominant Follicle\\nAs early as day 5–7, one of the follicles \\nout of so many becomes dominant and \\nundergoes further maturation. It seems probable \\nthat the one with highest antral concentration \\nof estrogen and lowest androgen: estrogen ratio \\n(estrogenic microenvironment) and whose \\ngranulosa cells contain the maximum receptors \\nfor FSH, becomes the dominant follicle. The rest of \\nthe follicles become atretic by day 8 (Fig. 8.3).\\nThere is marked enlargement of the granulosa cells \\nwith lipid inclusion. The granulosa cells surround the \\novum to form cumulus oophorus or discus proligerus \\nwhich infact anchors the ovum to the wall of the \\nfollicle. The cells adjacent to the ovum are arranged \\nradially and is called corona radiata (Figs 8.2 and \\n8.4). At this stage, FSH induces LH receptors on the \\ngranulosa cells of the dominant follicle.

The cumulus \\nbecomes detached from the wall, so that the ovum \\nwith the surrounding cells (corona radiata) floats \\nfreely in the liquor folliculi. The oocyte completes \\nthe first meiotic division with extrusion of the first \\npolar body which is pushed to the perivitelline space. \\nThe follicular wall near the ovarian surface becomes \\nthinner.The stigma develops as a conical projection \\nwhich penetrates the outer surface layer of the ovary \\nand persists for a while (30–120 seconds) as a thin \\nmembrane. The cumulus escapes out of the follicle by \\na slow oozing process, taking about 60–120 seconds \\nalong with varying amount of follicular fluid. The \\nstigma is soon closed by a plug of plasma.\\nCauses\\nThe following are the possible explanations which \\nmay operate singly or in combination.\\n1. Endocrinal\\n x LH surge \\nSustained peak level of estrogen for 24–48 hours \\nin the late follicular phase results in LH surge from \\nthe anterior pituitary (positive feedback effect). \\nEffective LH surge persists for about 24 hours. \\nThe LH surge stimulates completion of retuction \\ndivision of the oocyte and initiates luteinization \\nof the granulosa cells, synthesis of progesterone \\nand prostaglandins.\\n x FSH rise \\nPreovulatory rise of 17-α-hydroxy progesterone \\nfacilitates the positive feedback action of estrogen \\nto induce FSH surge → increase in plasminogen \\nactivator → plasminogen → plasmin → helps \\nlysis of the wall of the follicle.\\nThus, the combined LH/FSH midcycle surge \\nis responsible for the final stage of maturation, \\nrupture of the follicle and expulsion of the oocyte.\\n2.

Menstruation is \\nunrelated to ovulation and anovular menstruation \\nis quite common during adolescence, following \\nchildbirth and in women approaching menopause.\\nCorpus Luteum\\nAfter ovulation, the ruptured Graafian follicle \\ndevelops into corpus luteum. The life cycle is divided \\ninto four stages:\\n \\uf0a1 Proliferation\\n \\uf0a1 Vascularization\\n \\uf0a1 Maturation\\n \\uf0a1 Regression\\nStage of Proliferation\\nThe collapsed walls of the empty follicle form \\nconvolutions. The opening through which the \\novum escapes soon becomes plugged with fibrin. \\nThe granulosa cells undergo hypertrophy without \\nmultiplication. The cells become larger, polyhedral \\nwith pale vesicular nuclei and frothy cytoplasm. The \\ncells are called granulosa lutein cells. The color of the \\ncorpus luteum at this stage is greyish yellow due to \\npresence of lipids (Fig. 8.5).\\nStage of Vascularization\\nWithin 24 hours of rupture of the follicle, small \\ncapillaries grow into granulosa layer towards the \\nlumen accompanied by lymphatics and fibroblasts. The \\nsprouting vessels may rupture and bleed in the cavity.\\nStage of Maturation\\nBy 4th day, the luteal cells have attained the maximum \\nsize. Approximately about 7–8 days following \\novulation, the corpus luteum attains a size of about \\n1–2 cm and reaches its secretory peak. There is \\nhypertrophy of the theca interna cells. The cells \\npersist in the periphery and in the septa and are \\ncalled paralutein cells. Some theca lutein cells called \\n‘K’ cells invade the granulosa layer. The lutein cells \\nbecome greatly enlarged and develop lipid inclusion, \\ngiving the cells a distinctive yellowish color. The \\ncolor is due to the pigment carotene.  The cavity \\nmay be small containing scanty fluid.\\nStage of Regression\\nOn the day 22–23 of cycle,  retrogression starts.\\nThe first evidence of degeneration is appearance of \\nvacuolation in the cells. There is deposition of fat \\nin the lutein cells and appearance of hyaline tissue \\nbetween them. The lutein cells atrophy and the corpus \\nluteum becomes corpus albicans. Regression of corpus \\nluteum is due to withdrawal of tonic LH support.\\nIf, however, fertilization occurs in the particular \\ncycle, regression fails to occur, instead it is converted \\ninto corpus luteum of pregnancy.\\nHormones in Relation to formation and \\nmaintenance of corpus luteum\\n1. FSH in presence of high level of estrogen \\ninduces LH receptors in the granulosa cells of \\nthe dominant follicle. Thereafter midcycle LH \\nsurge causes luteinization of the granulosa cells \\nand progesterone secretion. LH secretion must \\nbe continued for the function of corpus luteum, \\nfailing which the corpus luteum will regress.\\n2.

The endometrium \\ncontains receptors for progesterone which are induced \\nby estrogen. Thus, the progesterone can only act on \\nthe endometrium previously primed by estrogen.\\nAll the components display their growth. It begins \\non day 15 and ceases 5–6 days prior to menstruation. \\nThe surface epithelium becomes more columnar \\nand ciliated at places. The glands show predominant \\nchanges. The glands increase in size. The lining \\nepithelium become taller. There is appearance of \\nvacuoles due to secretion of glycogen between the \\nnuclei and the basement membrane. This is called \\nsubnuclear vacuolation, which is the earliest (36–48 \\nhours) evidence of progesterone effect (ovulation). \\nThe subnuclear vacuolation persists until about \\n21st day of cycle. The intracellular secretion then \\nenters the gland lumina on the way to the uterine \\ncavity pushing the nuclei back towards the basement \\nmembrane. The effect is a saw-toothed glandular \\nepithelium. The fluid has got nutritive value for any \\nfertilized ovum reaching the uterus during that time. \\nThe glands become corkscrew\\xadshaped.

The slide so sent is stained either with \\nPapanicolaou’s or Sorr’s method and examined by a \\ntrained cytologist. Indeed, trained cytopathologist \\nand cytotechnologist are vital for the success of \\nany screening program (Table 9.1). \\nBENEFITS: The objective of screening is to reduce the \\nincidence and mortality from cervical cancer. Even a \\nsingle smear in a life time, if appropriately timed, will \\nproduce some benefits. If extended only to high-risk \\ngroup, the mortality from the cancer deaths will still \\nbe reduced to 60 percent.\\nPap smear test has been effective reducing the \\nincidence of cervical cancer by 80% and the morta-\\nlity by 70%. As a result of Pap test, more and more \\npreinvasive carcinoma is detected. Opportunistic \\nscreening done by a trained staff is effective when \\nfollow-up (call and recall) is maintained. Pap testing \\nafter total hysterectomy, done for benign lesion is not \\nrecommended.\\nINTERVALS : All sexually active women should be \\nscreened starting from the age of 21 years or after  \\n3 years of vaginal sex with no upper age limits. \\nScreening should be yearly till the age of 30. \\nThereafter, it should be done at an interval of every \\n2–3 years after three consecutive yearly negative \\nsmears (ACOG 2009). The high risk group should \\nbe screened with HPV DNA testing combined with \\ncytology (p. 324). The negative predictive value \\nof one negative HPV DNA test and two negative \\ncytology tests are almost 100%.

Another glass slide is placed over it. Because \\nof increased elasticity due to high estrogen level \\nduring this period, the mucus placed between \\nthe slides can withstand stretching up to a \\ndistance of over 10 cm. After ovulation when \\ncorpus luteum forms, progesterone is secreted. \\nUnder its action, the cervical mucus looses its \\nproperty of elasticity and while attempting the \\nabove procedure, the mucus fractures when put \\nunder tension much earlier. This loss of elasticity \\nafter its presence in the midcycle is the indirect \\nevidence of ovulation.\\n\\uf0be Fern test— During the midcycle, the cervical \\nmucus is obtained by a platinum loop or pipette \\nand spread on a clean glass slide and dried. When \\nseen under low power microscope, it shows \\ncharacteristic pattern of fern formation. It is \\ndue to high sodium chloride and low protein \\ncontent in the mucus due to high estrogen in the \\nmidmenstrual phase prior to ovulation. After \\novulation with increasing progesterone, the \\nferning disappears completely after 21st day. \\nThus, the presence of ferning even after 21st \\nday suggests anovulation and its disappearance \\nis presumptive evidence of ovulation (Fig. 9.19).\\nThe cervical scoring system of Insler (1979) takes \\ninto the account the amount, spinnbarkeit, ferning of the \\nmucus along with state of the external os of the cervix. A \\nscore of 10–12 indicates complete follicular maturation. \\nINFERTILITY  INVESTIGATIONS\\nPostcoital test (PCT)—Marion Sims (1866) and \\nMax Huhner (1913)\\nCervical mucus is a glycoprotein gel with interstitial \\nchannel between mucin strands. These strands expand \\nand contract in response to steroid hormones. This \\nhelps sperm transport upwards (see Fig. 16.4).\\nPrinciple: It is the examination of the cervical mucus \\nto evaluate the presence of progressively motile \\nsperm in it. This test is done several hours after \\n(within 8–12 hours) sexual intercouse. Presence of at \\nleast 10 progressively motile sperm per high power \\nfield signifies the test is normal. PCT has got poor \\npredictive value. Moreover, the test procedure is \\ninconvenient and embrassing. Routine postcoital test \\nis not recommended.\\nCOLPOSCOPY\\nThe instrument was devised by Hinselmann in \\n1925. Colposcope and colpomicroscope are \\nthe low-power binocular microscope, mounted \\non a stand.  It is designed to magnify the surface \\nepithelium of the vaginal part of the cervix including \\nentire transformation zone. The magnification is to \\nthe extent of 15–40 times in colposcopy and about \\n100–300 times in colpomicroscopy (Fig. 9.20).\\nProcedure: The patient is placed in lithotomy \\nposition. The cervix is visualized using a Cusco’s \\nspeculum (Fig. 9.5). Colposcopic examination of \\nthe cervix and vagina is done using low power \\nmagnification (6-16 fold). Cervix is then cleared \\nof any mucus discharge using a swab soaked with \\nnormal saline. Green filter and high magnification \\ncan be used now.

Cross-sectional images of the body are taken \\nat very close intervals (few millimeters thick) in the \\nform of multiple slices. CT can differentiate tissue \\ndensities and this gray-scale pictures can be read \\non an X-ray film or a television monitor. Pelvic \\norgans could be differentiated from gastrointestinal \\nand urinary systems using contrast media. Contrast \\nmedia can be given orally, IV or rectally. CT is most \\nuseful in the diagnosis of lymph node metastases, \\ndepth of myometrial invasion in endometrial cancer, \\novarian mass and myomas. CT can detect enlarged \\nlymph nodes but cannot differentiate between \\nbenign hyperplasia or metastatic carcinoma. How-\\never, lymph nodes must be enlarged at least by \\n2 cm to be detected by CT. Cerebral metastases \\nof choriocarcinoma or microadenoma of the \\npituitary can best be detected by CT procedure. CT \\nscan also facilitates the percutaneous needle biopsy \\nof suspicious lymph nodes. In obese or in cases of \\ndistended stomach or gut, it is an ideal alternative to \\nsonar (see Fig. 37.81). CT is useful in assessing tumor \\nextent and detecting metastases (Fig. 9.21). CT has \\nits role in staging of ovarian cancer as it can detect \\npertoneal, omental and serosal deposits in addition to \\nliver and nodal (retroperitoneal and intraperito-neal) \\nmetastasis (see p. 662). It is superior to ultrasound. \\nLower limit of detectable intraperitoneal implants is \\nbetween 1 and 5 mm. CT scans are useful in evaluat-\\ning pituitary tumors. The best images from CT are \\nobtained when there are significant differences in \\ntissue densities. Helical CT is a current modification \\nand has many advantages. Helical CT has replaced \\npulmonary angiography and ventilation-perfusion \\nscans for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. \\nHowever, it is more costly and there is chance of \\nsurface radiation. Surface radiation dose of CT scan \\nof the abdomen and pelvis is between 2 and 10 cGY . \\nHowever, value of CT in the assessment of pelvic \\norgans is limited. MRI is preferred where available.\\nMAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)\\nThe phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance was \\nfirst described by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell \\nin 1946. MR as a basis for an imaging technique \\nwas employed in practice about 30 years later by \\nLauterbur.\\nThe MRI creates cross-sectional images of the \\nbody using a combination of radiowaves (nonionizing \\nradiation) and magnetic fields. Biologic tissue nuclei \\nwith protons or neutrons have got magnetic properties. \\nWhen a pulse of radiowaves is imposed on the nuclei a \\nstrong resonance will occur and the energy is absorbed \\nby the nuclei. A signal is detected in a receiver coil, \\nFig. 9.21:  CT scan of the pelvis showing an ovarian mass'),\n",

The strength of the emitted signal \\nvaries directly with the proton density. In gynecology, \\nresolution is 0.5 to 1 mm. The radiowaves penetrate \\nbone and air without attenuation. Respiratory \\nmovements have got little effect on the pelvic \\norgans. Sagittal and coronal views can be obtained \\nwithout moving the patient. Patients with implants \\n(pacemakers) cannot undergo MRI.

However, neither CT nor MRI can detect \\nmicroscopic malignant disease (see p. 664).\\nMRI is twice more expensive than CT.\\nHazards \\nMain hazards are electroconvulsions and atrial \\nfibrillation. This is due to rapidly changing magnetic \\nfield. Hence, caution should be exercised with \\nepileptic patients and who had recent myocardial \\ninfarction. Other limitation of MRI is patient accept-\\nance. Many patient feel ‘trapped’ in the machine \\n(psychological distress).\\nPOSITR ON EMISSION  TOMOGRAPHY  \\n(PET)\\nThe PET is based on the tissue uptake of 18F-fluoro-2 \\ndeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG-PET can measure the \\ndifference between the normal tissue and cancerous \\ntissue. Cancer tissues process this glucose analogue \\ndifferently compared to that of normal tissues. This \\nglucose analogue is given IV . FDG-PET scan is then \\ndone and the images are interpreted. \\nFDG-PET scan is more sensitive for detection \\nof metastatic disease and recurrence of ovarian or \\ncervical malignancy. It is also useful to assess the \\nresponse following tumor therapy. FDG-PET scan is \\nfound to be more sensitive and specific compared to \\nCT or MRI.\\nSensitivity of PET in detecting pelvic node metastasis \\nis 80% compared to MRI (70%) and CT (48%). \\nCONCLuSIONS\\nAll the imaging systems have got their role in gyne-\\ncological practice.\\nX-ray, either plain or using contrast media, has \\ngot its place.

Annual \\nCBE of women with age > 40 years is recommended (ACOG).\\n h CBE begins with inspection and then a thorough palpation (see p. 565). The examiner should check for nipple \\ndischarge (see p. 566) as well as the axillary lymph nodes (see p. 565). \\n h Bladder should be empty prior to examination.\\n h Abdominal palpation should be done with the flat of the hand rather than the tips of the fingers. Whether a mass \\nis felt or not, routine palpation of the viscera includes liver, spleen, cecum, pelvic colon, gallbladder and kidneys. \\n h It is mandatory to elicit presence of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity in all cases of pelvic tumors.\\n h Pelvic examination includes inspection of external genitalia, vaginal examination (inspection with a speculum, \\npalpation and bimanual examination), rectal examination and rectovaginal examination.\\n h Rectovaginal examination is of special help to differentiate a growth arising from the ovary or rectum.\\n h Dyskaryosis is the morphological abnormality of the nucleus. It may be mild, moderate or severe. Koilocytosis \\nis associated with human papilloma virus infection.\\n h As a screening procedure, the material from the cervix is best collected using Ayre’s spatula. About 5 cases of \\ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia are diagnosed per 1000 patients and invasive carcinoma of the cervix in order \\nof 1 in 1000. The Pap smear screening should best be done at interval of 3 years after 2 yearly negative smears \\nfrom 18 years to 60 years. However, screening interval depends on patient’s risk level (Table 9.1).\\n h Diagnostic accuracy of Pap smear after three consecutive negative tests is about 99 percent.\\n h For cytohormonal study, the smear is taken from the lateral wall of the upper-third of the vagina. The estrogenic \\nsmear is suggested by preponderance of large eosinophilic cells with pyknotic nuclei. The progesterone smear \\nis predominantly basophilic with vesicular nuclei.

Vascular images are so high quality that it has replaced pulmonary angiography and \\nventilation-perfusion scans. Surface radiation dose from CT is between 2 and 10 rads.\\n h MRI uses radiowaves (nonionising) and magnetic fields. It accurately shows parametrial invasion of cervical \\ncancer but cannot reliably identify the lymph node metastases. It can measure the depth of myometrial \\npenetration in endometrial carcinoma preoperatively. High resolution images in multiple planes are obtained. \\nTumour volume can be measured with 3D imaging system.\\n h MRI should not be used in pateints with cochlear implants or pacemakers.

There is gross destruction of \\nthe epithelial cells, cilia and microvilli. In severe \\ninfection, it invades all the layers of the tube and \\nproduces acute inflammatory reaction; becomes \\nedematous and hyperemic. The exfoliated cells \\nalong with the exudate pour into the lumen of \\nthe tube and agglutinate the mucosal folds. The \\nabdominal ostium is closed by the indrawing of the \\nedematous fimbriae and by inflammatory adhesions. \\nThe uterine end is closed by congestion. The closure \\nof both the ostia results in pent up of the exudate \\ninside the tube. Depending upon the virulence, the \\nexudate may be watery producing hydrosalpinx \\nor purulent producing pyosalpinx. The purulent \\nexudate then changes the microenvironment of the \\ntube which favors growth of other pyogenic and \\nanaerobic organisms resulting in deeper penetration \\nand more tissue destruction. The organisms \\nspontaneously die within 2–3 weeks. As the serous \\ncoat is not much affected, the resulting adhesions \\nof the tube with the surrounding structures are \\nnot so dense, in fact flimsy, unlike pyogenic or \\ntubercular infection.\\nOn occasions, the exudate pours through the \\nabdominal ostium to produce pelvic peritonitis and \\npelvic abscess or may affect the ovary (the organisms \\ngain access through the ovulation rent) producing \\novarian abscess.

Too \\noften, multiple organisms are present and it is difficult \\nto pinpoint a particular organism responsible for a \\nparticular type of infection.\\nAs previously mentioned, the defence is lost following \\nchildbirth and abortion. Malnutrition, unhygienic \\nenvironment during delivery, dehydration and ketoacidosis \\nduring labor are the additional factors in underprivileged \\nwomen. Infections are common following cesarean section. \\nFollowing abortion, specially when induced criminally, \\nexogenous infection is quite likely and potentially virulent.\\nPathology\\nThe infection is either localized to the cervix, producing \\nacute cervicitis or may affect the placental site producing \\nendometritis. The infection may spread to the myometrium \\nproducing endomyometritis which is limited by a \\nleucocytic barrier. On occasion, the infection spreads to \\nthe parametrium, usually to one side, through lymphatics \\nor directly through the tear of the cervix; thereby gaining \\naccess to the base of the broad ligament. The infection may \\nalso spread upwards through the tubal openings into the \\ntubal lumen producing endosalpingitis. Thus, the fallopian \\ntube is affected either from outside following parametritis, \\nthrough lymphatics producing perisalpingitis or through \\nendosalpingitis. The ovary may be affected through \\ninvolvement of the tube or following pelvic peritonitis. \\nThus, an acute tubo-ovarian mass is formed (Fig. 10.2).\\nSpread of infection: Depending upon the virulence of the \\norganisms and resistance of the host, the following events \\nmay occur. \\nThe infection is localized principally to the cervix \\nand subsequently develops into chronic cervicitis. The \\nparametrial exudate may resolute completely leaving \\nbehind scarring or fibrosis or may undergo suppuration. The \\nabscess so formed usually points above the inguinal ligament. \\nThe tubal affection results in cornual block, hydro-salpinx \\nor pyosalpinx following blockage of the fimbrial end.

Speculum examination \\nmay reveal exposed vaginal cuff with purulent \\ndischarge coming through the gaping vault. Rectal \\nexamination reveals induration on the vault or its \\nextension to one side (parametritis). Rarely, a fluctuant \\nmass may be felt (pelvic abscess).\\ntreatment: Prophylactic \\nPreoperative cleaning of the vagina with antise-ptic \\nlotion, perfect hemostasis during surgery and leaving \\nbehind the vault open in infected cases could reduce \\nthe postoperative infection. Chemoprophylaxis  \\nin potentially or actually infected cases using \\nintravenous metronidazole 500 mg 8 hourly for 3 \\nsuch and intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g, given during \\nthe operation and 1–2 doses after the operation is \\nquite effective to lower the risk of infection.\\nDefinitive treatment:  Appropriate antibiotic and \\ndrainage of pus through the vault are enough to arrest the \\ninfection.

Risk of \\nPID is highest in the first month after insertion. Again \\nrisk of PID is highest when the patient has multiple \\nsexual partners.\\nAs a preventive measure, it is better not to insert \\nin nulliparae or in cases with previous history of \\npelvic inflammatory disease. Insertion should be \\ncarried out under strict aseptic condition. Once the \\npelvic infection occurs, the device should be removed \\nin addition to antibiotic and supportive therapy. \\nActinomycosis responds well with penicillin.\\nchrOnic peLVic infectiOn\\nChronic pelvic infection is a distressing clinical entity \\nnot only to the patients but also to the physicians. It \\nresults:\\n x Following acute pelvic infection—the initial \\ntreatment was delayed or inadequate.\\n x Following low grade recurrent infection.\\n x Tubercular infection.\\nThe first two types are predominantly due to \\npyogenic organisms. There is often history of previ-\\nous acute pelvic infection. Tubercular infection is \\nchronic from the beginning and is described as a \\nseparate entity.\\npYOgenic\\nPathology\\nThe pathology in the uterus is most often spared \\nbecause of periodic shedding of the endometrium. The \\ntubal changes are secondary to the changes induced \\nby previous acute salpingitis. The tubal epithelium is \\nusually lost, specially in gonococcal infection; the wall \\ngets thickened with plasma cell infiltration and the \\nopenings are blocked. These result in hydrosalpinx, \\nwith loss of the lining mucosa with its plicae. The \\nperitoneal surface is involved in recurrent infection \\nproducing either flimsy (gonococcal) or dense (non-\\ngonococcal pyogenic) adhesions. The tubes are thus \\nkinked and may get adherent to the ovaries, uterus, \\nintestine, omentum and pelvic peritoneum. A tubo-\\novarian mass or a frozen pelvis results. The serum \\nand lymphatic exudate in the parametrium of acute \\ninfection coagulates, which later either completely \\nresolutes or becomes fibrotic. The fibrosis pulls the \\nuterus, the cervix in particular to the same side.\\nclinical features\\n \\x9d The entity may remain asymptomatic.\\n \\x9d There may be previous history of acute pelvic \\ninfection following childbirth or abortion. \\nRecurrent episodes of reinfection is often present. \\nThe use of IUCD is highly corroborative.\\nsymptoms\\n x Chronic pelvic pain of varying magnitude and \\nthe pain aggravates prior to menstruation due to \\ncongestion.\\n x Dyspareunia, which is deep and may be located \\nunilaterally or bilaterally.\\n x Congestive dysmenorrhea.\\n x Lower abdominal pain.\\n x Menorrhagia or polymenorrhagia are due to \\ncongestion.\\n x Vaginal discharge is almost a constant manife-\\nstation and may be mucoid or mucopurulent.\\n x Infertility, which may be primary or more \\ncommonly secondary.\\nImportant factors for infertility are—cornual block \\n(Fig. 37.69), loss of cilia, loss of peristalsis due to \\nthickening of the tubal wall, closure of the abdominal \\nostium and distortion of the tube due to peritubal \\nadhesions. \\nOn examination\\nPer abdomen: There may be tenderness \\non one or both iliac fossa. An irregular \\ntender pelvic mass may be felt. \\nPer vaginam:  The findings are as \\nmentioned in page 130.\\nRectal examination corroborates the findings of \\nvaginal examination and should not be omitted \\n(p. 108).

The incidence is about 1 per cent amongst \\nthe gynecological patients attending the outpatient \\ndepartment in the developing countries. Incidence is \\nhigh (5–10%) amongst the patients with infertility. \\nWith the prevalence of HIV infection incidence of \\ngenital tuberculosis is rising. About 10 per cent of \\nwomen with pelvic tuberculosis, have urinary tract \\ntuberculosis.\\npathOgenesis\\nThe causative organism is Mycobacterium tuber-\\nculosis of human type. Very rarely the bovine type \\nmay affect the vulva. Genital tuberculosis is almost \\nalways secondary to primary infection elsewhere \\nin the extragenital sites such as lungs (50%), lymph \\nnodes, urinary tract, bones and joints. The fallopian \\ntubes are invariably the primary sites of pelvic \\ntuberculosis from where secondary spread occurs to \\nother genital organs.\\nmOde Of spread\\nHematogenous: From any of the primary sites, \\nthe pelvic organs are involved by hematogenous \\nspread in about 90 per cent cases. If the post-primary \\nhematogenous spread coincides with the growth spurt \\nof the pelvic vessels, the genital organs, the tubes in \\nparticular, are likely to be affected. Thus, the pelvic \\norgans are infected during puberty. If the spread \\nprecedes the growth phase, the genital organs are \\nspared. The infection remains dormant for a variable \\nperiod of time (4–6 years) until clinical manifestations \\nappear (Fig. 10.3).\\nLymphatic or direct: The pelvic organs are involved \\ndirectly or by lymphatics from the infected organs \\nsuch as peritoneum, bowel or mesenteric nodes.\\nAscending: Although difficult to prove but sexual \\ntransmission from a male with urogenital tuberculosis \\nis possible in vulval, vaginal or cervical lesion.\\npathOLOgY Of peLVic Organs\\nFallopian tube: The commonest site of affection \\nis the fallopian tubes (100%). Both the tubes are \\nCh-10.indd   137 13-11-2013   12:28:01'),\n",

The initial site of infe-\\nction is in the submucosal layer (interstitial salpin-\\ngitis) of the ampullary part of the tube.\\nThe infection may spread medially along the wall \\ncausing destruction of the muscles which are replaced \\nby fibrous tissue. The walls get thickened, become \\ncalcified or even ossified. The thickening may at \\ntime become segmented. The infection may spread \\ninwards; the mucosa gets swollen and destroyed. \\nThe fimbria are everted and the abdominal ostium \\nusually remains patent. The elongated and distended \\ndistal tube with the patent abdominal ostium gives \\nthe appearance of “tobacco-pouch” . Occlusion of \\nthe ostium may however occur due to adhesions. \\nThe tubercles burst pouring the caseous material \\ninside the lumen producing tubercular pyosalpinx, \\nwhich may adhere to the ovaries and the surrounding \\nstructures. Often the infection spreads outwards \\nproducing perisalpingitis with exudation, causing \\ndense adhesions with the surrounding structures—\\ntubercular tubo-ovarian mass. Rarely, miliary \\ntubercles may be found on the serosal surface of the \\ntubes, uterus, peritoneum or intestines. These are often \\nassociated with tubercular peritonitis (Fig. 10.4).\\nHowever, not infrequently the tubes may look \\nabsolutely normal or nodular at places. If the nodules \\nhappen to be present in the isthmus near the uterine \\ncornu, it constitutes salpingitis isthmica nodosa. \\nSalpingitis isthmica nodosa is the nodular thickening \\nof the tube due to proliferation of tubal epithelium \\nwithin the hypertrophied myosalpinx (muscle \\nlayer). Exact aetiology is unknown. It is diagnosed \\nradiologically as a small diverticulum (Fig. 10.7). It is \\nhowever not specific to tubercular infection only (see \\np. 172). It is also observed in pelvic endometriosis. \\nUterus: The endometrium is involved in 60 per \\ncent of cases. The infection is from the tubes either \\nby lymphatics or by direct spread through conti-\\nnuity. Cornual ends are commonly affected due to \\ntheir dual blood supply, as well as their anatomical \\nproximity to tubes. The tubercle is situated in the \\nbasal layer of the endometrium only to come to the \\nsurface premenstrually. After the endometrium is \\nshed at each menstruation, reinfection occurs from \\nthe lesions in the basal layer or from the tubes. \\nEndometrial ulceration may lead to adhesion or \\nsynechiae formation (Asherman’s syndrome). \\nThis may cause infertility, secondary amenorrhea \\nor recurrent abortion (p. 459). Rarely, the infection \\nspreads to the myometrium (2.5%) and if caseation \\noccurs, a pyometra results, specially in postmeno-\\npausal women.\\nCervix: The cervical affection is not so uncommon \\n(5–15%). Primary infection of the cervix by sexual \\nintercourse though rare, has been recorded. It may \\nbe ulcerative or may be bright nodular in type.

Typical \\ngranuloma consists of infiltration of multinuclea-\\nted giant cells (Langhans), chronic inflammatory \\ncells and epithelioid cells,  surrounding a central \\narea of caseation necrosis (Fig. 10.5). Caseation may \\nnot be a constant feature.\\ncLinicaL  featUres\\nPatient profile: The infection is restricted mostly \\n(80%) to childbearing period (20–40 years). There \\nmay be past history of tubercular affection of the \\nlungs or lymph glands. Genital tuberculosis occurs \\nin 10–20 per cent of patients who have pulmonary \\ntuberculosis in adolescence. A family history of \\ncontact may be available. Onset is mostly insidious. \\nA flare up of the infection may occur acutely either \\nspontaneously or following diagnostic endometrial \\ncurettage or hysterosalpingography.\\nSymptoms: Symptoms vary considerably with the \\nseverity and stage of the disease. At one extreme, \\nthere is neither any symptom nor any palpable pelvic \\npathology. Sometimes symptoms like weakness, low \\ngrade fever, anorexia, anemia or night sweats may be \\npresent. The lesion is accidentally diagnosed during \\ninvestigation for infertility or dysfunctional uterine \\nbleeding. These cases are often designated as “silent \\ntuberculosis”. In others, the clinical manifestations \\nappear. These are:\\nInfertility: It may be primary or secondary and \\nis present in about 70–80 per cent cases of pelvic \\ntuberculosis. In India, about 10 per cent infertile \\nwomen have got genital tuberculosis. The causes are \\npredominantly due to tubal blockage, adhesions in the \\nendometrial cavity (uterine synechiae) or associated \\novulatory dysfunction.\\nMenstrual abnormality: In about 50 per cent, the \\nmenstrual function is normal.\\nfig. 10.5:  A typical tubercular granuloma formed by \\nlymphocytes, epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells. \\nCentral area of caseation necrosis is seen\\nCh-10.indd   139 13-11-2013   12:28:02'),\n",

A patient with a STI is likely to have another one. Chlamydia trachomatis \\nis now on the top in the list of the organisms causing STIs, the other common diseases are bacterial vaginosis, \\ngonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomonas vaginitis.\\n \\uf086 Neisseria gonorrhoeae commonly invades the columnar and transitional epithelium of the genitourinary tract \\n(endocervix, urethra, Bartholin’s gland). Infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain are the long-term \\ncomplications (p. 148). Investigations should include for other STIs also.\\n \\uf086 Herpes genitalis is caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2. Acyclovir orally in doses of 200 mg 5 \\ntimes a day for 7 days is effective in reducing the constitutional symptoms, duration of viral shedding, and \\nhelps rapid healing.\\n \\uf086 Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum. The hard chancre of primary syphilis is painless with an indurated \\nbase. VDRL and TPHA tests are used for screening and FTA–abs is used for conﬁ  rmation. Treatment according \\nto CDC recommendation includes Benzathine-penicillin IM (see p. 149).\\n \\uf086 Chancroid (soft sore) is caused by a Gram-negative Haemophilus ducreyi and is always painful. Unilateral \\ninguinal lymphadenitis may occur which may suppurate to form abscess. Demonstration of Ducreyi bacillus \\nfrom the discharge of the ulcer or aspirated pus from the lymph gland is conﬁ  rmatory. Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM \\nsingle dose is effective.\\n \\uf086 Granuloma inguinale is caused by Gram-negative Donovania granulomatis. There is localized ulcer formation \\nwithout lymph node suppuration and abscess formation. Diagnosis is conﬁ  rmed by demonstrating Donovan \\nbodies within the mononuclear cells (p. 151). Doxycycline, 100 mg BID for at least 3 weeks is effective.\\n \\uf086 Lymphogranuloma venerum is caused by L serotype Chlamydia trachomatis. The inguinal glands are involved \\nearly, become necrosed and abscess forms. Healing occurs with intense ﬁ  brosis and lymphatic obstruction (p. \\n151). Doxycycline100 mg BID for atleast 21 days is effective.\\n \\uf086 AIDS is caused by human immunodeﬁ  ciency virus (HIV). The methods of transmission are by sexual intercourse, \\ntransfusion of contaminated blood or blood products, use of contaminated needles, and vertical transmission \\nto the baby (25–35%) during pregnancy and childbirth. Male condom is protective. It suppresses the immune \\nsystem (depletion of CD 4+ T lymphocytes) so that the opportunistic organisms ﬂ are up.\\n  Plasma HIV-RNA levels indicate the degree of viral replication and CD 4+ T cell count indicate level of immune \\ncompetence (p. 156).

This is due to re-emergence of VZV from \\nposterior nerve roots. It produces an inflammatory \\npainful eruption of groups of vesicles distributed over \\nthe skin corresponding to the course of peripheral \\nsensory nerves (dermatome). It is commonly unilateral \\nbut may extend to the thigh or buttock of the same \\nside. The vesicles may rupture or become dry with \\nscab formation. It resolves spontaneously in 3 weeks \\ntime.\\nTreatment is by analgesics to relieve pain and \\nantibiotics to prevent secondary infection. Acyclovir \\n800 mg orally five times daily for 7 days is reco-\\nmmended. Acyclovir cream (5%) may be used locally \\nfor less severe infection.\\nFUNgAL  INFECTION\\nMoniliasis: See p. 164.\\nRingworm: The causative organism is Tinea cruris. \\nThe lesions look bright red and circumscribed. The \\nfungus can be detected microscopically from scraping \\nof the lesion.\\nTreatment is very effective with imidazole (clotri-\\nmazole or miconazole) cream. Some fungi (Tricho-\\nphyton rubrum) respond well to griseofulvin 500 mg \\ntwice daily by mouth for 4 weeks.\\npArASITIC  INFECTION\\nThreadworm: The causative organism is Oxyuris \\nvermicularis. It is common in children. Nocturnal \\nperineal itching with evidences of perianal exco-\\nriation is observed. The parasite is detected in the \\nstool. Anthelmintic drugs such as mebendazole and \\nlocal application of gentian violet cures the condition.\\nINFECTIONS OF BArTHOLIN’S gLAND\\nBartholin’ s glands are the two pea sized (2 cm) \\nglands, located in the groove between the hymen and \\nthe labia minora at 5 O’Clock and 7 O’Clock position \\n(see p. 2) of the vagina.\\nCausative Organisms: Although Gonococcus is \\nalways in mind but more commonly other pyogenic \\norganisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, \\nStreptococcus, or Chlamydia trachomatis or mixed \\ntypes (polymicrobial) are involved.\\nPathology: Both the gland and the duct are involved. \\nThe epithelium of the gland or the duct gets swollen. \\nThe lumen of the duct may be blocked or remains open \\nthrough which exudates escape out.\\nFate: The infection may resolute completely or an \\nabscess is formed. In others, the infection subsides \\nonly to recur in future. In such cases, the gland \\nbecomes fibrotic. Too often, the duct lumen heals \\nby fibrosis with closure of the orifice → pent up \\nsecretion of the gland → formation of bartholin cyst. \\nThus, the end results of acute Bartholinitis are:  \\n(i) Complete resolution (ii) Recurrence (iii) Abscess \\n(iv) Cyst formation.\\nClinical Features: Initially, there is local pain \\nand discomfort even to the extent of difficulty in \\nwalking or sitting. Examination reveals tenderness \\nand induration of the posterior half of the labia when \\npalpated between thumb outside and the index finger \\ninside the vagina (see Fig. 9.6). The duct opening \\nlooks congested and secretion comes out through \\nthe opening when the gland is pressed by fingers. \\nThe secretion should be collected with a swab for \\nbacteriological examination.\\nTreatment: Hot compress over the area and anal-\\ngesics to relieve pain are instituted.

Excision of \\nthe gland with the duct may have to be done in the \\nquiescent phase.\\nBArTHOLIN’S ABSCESS\\nBartholin’s abscess is the end result of acute bartho-\\nlinitis. The duct gets blocked by fibrosis and the \\nexudates pent up inside to produce abscess. If left \\nuncared for, the abscess may burst through the lower \\nvaginal wall. A sinus tract may remain with periodic \\ndischarge through it.\\nClinical Features \\nThe local pain and discomfort become intense. \\nThe patient cannot walk or even sit. Fever is often \\nassociated.\\nOn examination, there is an unilateral tender \\nswelling beneath the posterior half of the labium \\nmajus expanding medially to the posterior part of the \\nlabium minus. The overlying skin appears red and \\nedematous.\\nTreatment: Rest is imposed. Pain is relieved by \\nanalgesics and daily sitz bath. Systemic antibiotic—\\nampicillin 500 mg orally 8 hourly or tetracycline in \\nchlamydial infection is effective. Abscess should be \\ndrained at the earliest opportunity before it bursts \\nspontaneously.\\nIn case of recurrent Bartholin’s abscess, excision \\nshould be done in the quiescent phase after the \\ninfection is controlled.\\nBArTHOLIN’S C yST\\nThere is closure of the duct or the opening of an \\nacinus.The cause may be infection or trauma follo-\\nwed by fibrosis and occlusion of the lumen. \\nPathology: It may develop in the duct (common) or in \\nthe gland. Commonly, it involves the duct; the gland \\nis adherent to it posterolaterally. Cyst of the duct or \\ngland can be differentiated by the lining epithelium. \\nThe content is glairy colorless fluid—secretion of the \\nBartholin’s gland.\\nClinical Features: A small size often remains \\nunnoticed to the patient or escapes attention to the \\nphysician even following internal examination. If \\nit becomes large (size of hen’s egg), there is local \\ndiscomfort and dyspareunia. Examination reveals \\nan unilateral swelling on the posterior half of the \\nlabium majus which opens up at the posterior end \\nof the labium minus. Its medial projection makes \\nthe vulval cleft ‘S’-shaped. The overlying skin is \\nthin and shiny. The cyst is fluctuant and not tender  \\n(Fig. 12.1).\\nTreatment: Marsupialization is the gratifying \\nsurgery for Bartholin’s cyst. An incision is made on \\nthe inner aspect of the labium minus just outside the \\nhymenal ring. The incision includes the vaginal wall \\nand the cyst wall. The cut margins of the either side \\nare to be trimmed off to make the opening an elliptical \\nshape and of about 1 cm in diameter. The edges of \\nthe vaginal and cyst wall are sutured by interrupted \\ncatgut, thus leaving behind a clean circular opening.\\nThe advantages of marsupialization over  \\nthe traditional excision operation are: (i) Simple.  \\nFig. 12.1: Bartholin’s cyst (left)'),\n",

There may \\nbe painful micturition.\\nInspection reveals soreness of the vulva. The labia \\nminora may be swollen and red. If a foreign body is \\nsuspected, a vaginal examination with an aural or nasal \\nspeculum may help in diagnosis.\\nInvestigations: The vaginal discharge is collected \\nwith a platinum loop and two smears are taken, one \\nfor direct examination and the other for Gram stain.\\nA small amount may be taken with a pipette \\nfor culture in Stuart’s media. To exclude intestinal \\ninfestation, stool examination is of help.\\nVaginoscopy is needed to exclude foreign body or \\ntumor in a case with recurrent infection.\\nTreatment: In most cases, the cause remains \\nunknown. Simple perineal hygiene will relieve the \\nsymptoms. In cases of soreness or after removal \\nof foreign body, estrogen cream is to be applied \\nlocally, every night for two weeks. When the specific \\norganisms are detected, therapy should be directed to \\ncure the condition.\\nTrICHOMONAS VA gINITIS\\nVaginal trichomoniasis is the most common and \\nimportant cause of vaginitis in the childbearing period.\\nCausative Organism: It is caused by Trichomo-\\nnas vaginalis, a pear-shaped unicellular flagellate \\nprotozoa. It measures 20 µ long and 10 µ wide (larger \\nthan a WBC). It has got four anterior flagellae and \\na spear-like protrusion at the other end with an \\nundulating membrane surrounding its anterior two-\\nthird. It is actively motile (Fig. 12.2).\\nMode of Transmission\\nThe organism is predominantly transmitted by sexual \\ncontact, the male harbors the infection in the urethra \\nand prostate.

When the local \\ndefence is impaired—during and after menstruation, \\nafter sexual stimulation, and following illness, the \\npH of the vagina is raised to 5.5–6.5. At this level \\nof pH, the trichomonads thrive. The organisms \\nusually lie in between the rugae and produce surface \\ninflammatory reaction when the defence is lost. In \\nabout 75 percent cases, the organism can be isolated \\nfrom the urethra, Skene’s tubules, or even from the \\nBartholin’s glands.\\nClinical Features\\n(a) There is sudden profuse and offensive vaginal \\ndischarge often dating from the last menstruation.\\n(b) Irritation and itching of varying degrees within \\nand around the introitus are common.\\n(c) There is presence of urinary symptoms such as \\ndysuria and frequency of micturition.\\n(d) There may be history of previous similar attacks.\\nWomen with trichomoniasis should be evaluated for \\nother STDs including N. gonorrheae, C. trachomatis, \\nand HIV .\\nOn Examination\\n(a) There is thin, greenish-yellow and frothy offensive \\ndischarge per vaginum.\\n(b) The vulva is inflamed with evidences of pruritus.\\n(c) Vaginal examination may be painful. The vaginal \\nwalls become red and inflamed with multiple \\npunctate hemorrhagic spots. Similar spots are also \\nfound over the mucosa of the portio vaginalis part \\nof the cervix on speculum examination giving the \\nappearance of ‘strawberry’ (Fig. 12.3).\\nDiagnosis\\n(a) Identification of the trichomonas is done by \\nhanging drop preparation (p. 110). If found  \\nnegative even on repeat examination, the \\nconfirmation may be done by culture.\\n(b) Culture of the discharge collected by swabs in \\nDiamond’s TYM or Feinberg Whittington medium.\\nIn suspected cases, gonococcal or monilial \\ninfection should be excluded.\\nTreatment \\nThe treatment is very much effective with \\nmetronidazole. Metronidazole 200 mg thrice daily by \\nmouth is to be given for 1 week. A single dose regimen \\nof 2 g is an alternative. Tinidazole single 2 gm dose \\nPO is equally effective.

The \\ninfection may be acute or chronic.\\nACUTE CEr VICITIS\\nThe endocervical infection  usually follows child-\\nbirth, abortion, or any operation on cervix. The \\nresponsible organisms are pyogenic (p. 127). Other \\ncommon pathogens are : Gonococcus, Chlamydia \\ntrachomatis, Trichamonas bacterial vaginosis, \\nMycoplasma and HPV, the first one being less \\ncommon nowadays.\\nThe organisms gain entry into the glands of \\nthe endocervix and produce acute inflammatory \\nchanges. The infection may be localised or spread \\nupwards to involve the tube or sidewards involving \\nthe parametrium.\\nClinical Features: The vaginal examination is painful. \\nThe cervix is tender on touch or movements. Cervix \\nlooks edematous and congested. Mucopurulent \\ndischarge is seen escaping out through the external os.\\nPrognosis: (a) It may resolve completely. (b) The \\ninfection may spread to involve the adjacent structures \\nor even beyond that. (c) Becomes chronic.\\nTreatment: High vaginal and endocervical swabs \\nare taken for bacteriological identification and drug \\nsensitivity test. Appropriate antibiotics should be \\nprescribed. General measures are to be taken as \\noutlined in acute pelvic infection (ch. 10).\\nCHrONIC CEr VICITIS\\nChronic cervicitis is the commonest lesion found \\nin women attending gynecologic outpatient. It may \\nfollow an acute attack or usually chronic from the \\nbeginning. The endocervix is a potential reservior \\nfor N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia, HPV , mycoplasma \\nand bacterial vaginosis.\\nPathology: The mucosa and the deeper tissues are \\ncongested, fibrosed, and infiltrated with leukocytes \\nand plasma cells. The glands are also hypertrophied \\nwith increased secretory activity. Some of the gland \\nmouths are closed by fibrosis or plugs of desquamated \\nepithelial cells to cause retention cyst — nabothian \\nfollicles (Fig. 18.4). Thus, in fact, it should be called \\nchronic endocervicitis as the ectocervix is protected by \\nthe overlying stratified squamous epithelium. There \\nis associated lacerated and everted endocervix, the \\nso-called eversion or ectropion.\\nClinical Features: There may not be any symptom as \\nit may be accidentally discovered during examination. \\nExcessive mucoid discharge, at times mucopurulent, \\nis the predominant symptom. History of contact \\nbleeding may be present.\\nOn examination: (a) The cervix may be tender to \\ntouch or on movement. (b) Speculum examination \\nreveals—mucoid or mucopurulent discharge escaping \\nout through the cervical os. There may be enlargement, \\ncongestion, or ectropion of the cervix.

This is because of cyclic shedding \\nof endometrium.\\nThe infection can gain foothold, however, when \\nthere is persistent source of infection in the uterine \\ncavity. Such conditions are IUCD, infected polyp, \\nretained products, uterine malignancy, and endometrial \\nburns due to radium. Tubercular endometritis is chronic \\nfrom the beginning and has been described in p. 138.\\nWomen often presents with purulent or \\nseropurulent vaginal discharge. Diagnosis is made by \\ncervical smear, culture of the discharge, transvaginal \\nultrasonography and histology, of the endometrium.\\nTreatment: The offending cause is to be removed \\nor eradicated. Levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily for 14 \\ndays with Metronidazole 400 mg PO twice daily for \\n14 days are given.\\nATrOpHIC ENDOMETrITIS  \\n(SENILE  ENDOMETrITIS)\\nFollowing menopause, due to deficiency of estrogen, \\nthe defense of the uterocervicovaginal canal is lost. \\nThere is no periodic shedding of the endometrium. \\nAs a result, organisms of low virulence can ascend \\nup to infect the atrophic endometrium. There \\nis intense infiltration of the endometrium with \\npolymorphonuclear leukocytes and plasma cells. \\nThe endometrium becomes ulcerated at places and \\nis replaced by granulation tissues. The purulent \\ndischarge either escapes out of the uterine cavity or \\nmay be pent up inside producing pyometra.\\nClinical Features: The postmenopausal women \\ncomplain of vaginal discharge, at times offensive \\nor even blood-stained. Pelvic examination reveals \\nfeatures of atrophic vaginitis. Purulent discharge may \\nbe seen escaping out through the cervix. In presence of \\npyometra, the uterus is enlarged; feels soft and tender. \\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis is confused with carcinoma of the \\nendometrium which must be excluded prior to \\ntreatment (see p. 356). In fact, pyometra may be \\npresent both in atrophic endometritis and endometrial \\ncarcinoma. Ultrasonography (TVS) is helpful to the \\ndiagnosis. Diagnostic curettage should be done and the \\nendometrium is subjected to histological examination.\\nIf however, pyometra is present, drainage of pus \\nby simple dilatation should be done first. After 1–2 \\nweeks, diagnostic curettage is to be done under cover \\nof antibiotics. \\nTreatment: In women with recurrent attacks, hyst-\\nerectomy should be done and the specimen should \\nbe subjected to histological examination.\\npyOMETr A\\nCollection of pus in the uterine cavity is called \\npyometra.

In every case, all types of investi-\\ngations are to be made to exclude malignancy of \\nthe body of the uterus and endocervix. Diagnostic \\ncurettage should be withheld for about 7–14 days \\nfollowing dilatation and drainage of pus. This will \\nminimize such complications such as perforation \\nof the uterus and spreading peritonitis. During the \\ninterval period, antibiotics should be prescribed.\\nTreatment: Once malignancy is excluded, the \\npyometra is drained by simple dilatation of the cervix. \\nEven in non-malignant cases or in cases of recurrence, \\nhysterectomy may be indicated.

Even if \\npregnancy occurs, chances of ectopic is more \\n(10–15%).\\nOOpHOrITIS\\nIsolated infection to the ovaries is a rarity. The ovaries \\nare almost always affected during salpingitis and \\nas such the nomenclature of salpingo-oophoritis is \\npreferred. The affection of the ovary from tubal \\ninfection occurs by the following routes:\\n x Directly from the exudates contaminating the \\novarian surface producing perioophoritis.\\n x Through lymphatics of the mesosalpinx and \\nmesovarium producing interstitial oophoritis.\\n x Blood borne—mumps.\\n x Through the rent of the ovulation producing \\ninterstitial oophoritis.\\nIf the organisms are severe, an abscess is formed \\nand a tubo-ovarian abscess results. In others, the \\novaries may be adherent to the tubes, intestine, \\nomentum, and pelvic peritoneum producing tubo-\\novarian mass (TO mass). Such a mass is usually \\nbilateral (Fig. 12.11).\\nDirect affection of the ovaries without tubal \\ninvolvement may be due to mumps or influenza. In \\nmumps, there is no sterilizing effect on the ovaries \\nunlike testes. This is because the capsule of the \\novary is elastic and as such, ischemic injury to the \\ngraafian follicles is not likely. Even if some follicles \\nare damaged, many are left behind to carry on the \\nreproductive function.\\nThe symptomatology and treatment are like those \\nof salpingitis.\\npArAMETrITIS\\nInflammation of the pelvic cellular tissue is called \\nparametritis.\\nEtiology—(Source of Infection)\\n \\x9d Delivery and abortion through placental site or \\nfrom lacerations of the cervix, vaginal vault, or \\nlower uterine segment.\\n \\x9d Acute infections of the cervix, uterus, and tubes.\\n \\x9d Cesarean section or hysterectomy-abdominal or \\nvaginal (cuff cellulitis).\\n \\x9d Secondary to pelvic peritonitis.\\n \\x9d Carcinoma cervix or radium introduction.\\nFig. 12.10:  Histology of salpingitis \\nisthmica nodosa.

The gratifying treatment is marsupialization under local anesthesia. \\nA normal Bartholin’s gland cannot be palpated.\\n Excision of Bartholin’s duct and gland is indicated for persistent and/or recurrent infections specially when it \\noccurs beyond the age of 40. \\n h During childbearing period, vaginal trichomoniasis is the commonest STD caused by Trichomonas vaginalis — a \\nflagellated parasite. Hanging drop preparation with identification of trichomonas is diagnostic. Treatment is \\nspecific with metronidazole to both partners. The husband is to use condom during treatment. Vaginitis may \\nbe due to other causes also (p. 164).\\n h A vaginal discharge with pH >5.0 indicates atrophic vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomonas infection \\nwhereas a vaginal discharge with pH <4.5 may be either physiologic or due to fungal infection. Vaginal discharge \\nneeds to be differentiated before treatment (Table 12.1) \\n h Moniliasis is caused by Candida albicans—a Gram-positive fungus. The infection is more likely related to diabetes, \\npregnancy, or amongst ‘pill’ users (p. 164).

Treatment is supportive. \\nb-lactamase resistant anti-staphylococcal penicillin (cloxacillin, methicillin) should be the choice.\\n h The feature of senile endometritis may simulate endometrial carcinoma which should be ruled out prior to \\ntreatment. Common causes of pyometra are endometrial carcinoma, endocervical carcinoma, senile endometritis, \\ninfected hematometra, and tubercular endometritis.\\n h Pyogenic non-gonococcal organisms affect the tubes by producing perisalpingitis; gonococcal produces \\nendosalpingitis and tubercular infection produces interstitial salpingitis.\\n h The organisms producing hydrosalpinx are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, E. coli, Gonococcus, Cl. trachomatis,  \\netc. Hydrosalpinx is the end result of repeated attacks of mild endosalpingitis. It may also be the end stage of \\npyosalpinx when the pus becomes liquefied. Prognosis of salpingitis in terms of reproductive function depends \\non the type of infection, severity, and number of episodes. When the cilia is damaged and or motility is impaired \\n(adhesion), prospect is very poor.\\n h Salpingitis isthmica nodosa may be one variety of endometriosis or related to tubercular infection.  \\nTube is nodular and thickened. There is proliferation of tubal epithelium within the muscle layer (myosalpinx).\\n h Pelvic abscess is the encysted pus in the pouch of Douglas. The common causes are following acute salpingitis, \\npostabortal sepsis, infected pelvic hematocele and postoperative pelvic peritonitis, etc.\\n Confirmation of diagnosis is by culdocentesis and the definitive surgery is drainage of pus through posterior \\ncolpotomy.\\n h Endocervix is the major reservoir of pathogenic organisms.

With the advent of oral contraceptives \\nand non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, there is \\nmarked relief of the symptom.\\nCauses of pain: The mechanism of initiation of \\nuterine pain in primary dysmenorrhea is difficult to \\nestablish. But the following are too often related.\\n \\x90 Mostly confined to adolescents.\\n \\x90 Almost always confined to ovulatory cycles.\\n \\x90 The pain is usually cured following pregnancy \\nand vaginal delivery.\\n \\x90 The pain is related to dysrhythmic uterine \\ncontractions and uterine hypoxia.\\n1. Psychosomatic factors of tension and anxiety \\nduring adolescence; lower the pain threshold.\\n2. Abnormal anatomical and functional aspect \\nof myometrium.\\n Uterine myometrial hyperactivity has been \\nobserved in cases with primary dysmenorrhea.\\n The outer myometrium and the subendometrial \\nmyometrium are found to be different structurally \\nand functionally. The subendometrial layer of \\nmyometrium is known as Junctional Zone (JZ). \\nThere is marked hyperperistalsis of the JZ in \\nwomen with endometriosis and adenomyosis. In \\nwomen with dysmenorrhea significant changes \\nin JZ are seen. These include irregular thickening \\nand hyperplasia of  smooth muscle and less \\nvascularity. This is known as Junctional zone \\nhyperplasia. Dysperistalsis and hyperactivity of \\nthe uterine JZ are the important mechanisms \\nof primary dysmenorrhea.\\n3. Imbalance in the autonomic nervous control  \\nof uterine muscle.\\n There is overactivity of the sympathetic nerves → \\nhypertonicity of the circular fibers of the isthmus \\nand internal os. The relief of pain following \\ndilatation of the cervix or following vaginal \\ndelivery may be explained by the damage of the \\nadrenergic neurons which fail to regenerate.\\n4. Role of prostaglandins \\n In ovulatory cycles, under the action of proge-\\nsterone, prostaglandins (PGF2α, PGE2) are synthe-\\nsized from the secretory endometrium. Prosta-\\nglandins are released with maximum production \\nduring shedding of the endometrium. PGF2α is \\na strong vasoconstrictor, which causes ischemia \\n(angina) of the myometrium.\\n Either due to increased production of the \\nprostaglandins or increased sensitivity of the \\nmyometrium to the normal production of \\nprostaglandins, there is increased myometrial \\ncontraction with or without dysrhythmia.  \\nCh-13.indd   178 13-11-2013   11:32:37'),\n",

Role of vasopressin: There is increased vaso-\\npressin release during menstruation in women \\nwith primary dysmenorrhea. This explains the \\npersistence of pain in cases even treated with \\nantiprostaglandin drugs. The mechanism of \\naction is yet to be explored. Vasopressin increases \\nprostaglandin synthesis and also increases \\nmyometrial activity directly. It causes uterine \\nhyperactivity and dysrhythmic contractions → \\nischemia and hypoxia → pain.\\n6. Endothelins causes myometrial smooth muscle \\ncontractions, specially in the endomyometrial \\nJunction (JZ). Endothelins in endometrium can \\ninduce PFG2α. Local myometrial ischemia caused \\nby endothelins and PGF 2α aggravate uterine \\ndysperistalsis and hyperactivity.\\n7. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is also associa-\\nted with the etiology of dysmenorrhea as its con-\\ncentration is found high.

Nausea or vomiting is conspicuously \\nabsent. It rarely lasts more than 12 hours. It may be \\nassociated with slight vaginal bleeding or excessive \\nmucoid vaginal discharge.\\nThe exact cause is not known. The probable \\nfactors are: (i) Increased tension of the Graafian \\nfollicle just prior to rupture, (ii) Peritoneal irritation \\nby the follicular fluid following ovulation and \\n(iii) Contraction of the tubes and uterus.\\nTreatment is effective with assurance and \\nanalgesics.

There is cyclic appearance \\nof a large number of symptoms during the last 7–10 \\ndays of the menstrual cycle. It should fulfil the \\nfollowing criteria (ACOG) :\\n \\x99 Not related to any organic lesion.\\n \\x99 Regularly occurs during the luteal phase of each \\novulatory menstrual cycle.\\n \\x99 Symptoms must be severe enough to disturb the life \\nstyle of the woman or she requires medical help. \\n \\x99 Symptom-free period during rest of the cycle.\\nWhen these symptoms disrupt daily functioning \\nthey are grouped under the name premenstrual \\ndysphoric disorder (PMDD).\\nPathophysiology: The exact cause is not known but \\nthe following hypotheses are postulated :\\n(a) Alteration in the level of estrogen and proge-\\nsterone starting from the midluteal phase. Either \\nthere is altered estrogen : progesterone ratio or \\ndiminished progesterone level.\\n(b) Neuroendocrine factors :\\n \\uf0bb Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter in \\nthe CNS. During the luteal phase, decreased \\nsynthesis of serotonin is observed in women \\nsuffering from PMS.\\n \\uf0bb Endorphins: The symptom complex of PMS \\nis thought to be due to the withdrawal of \\nendorphins (neurotransmitters) from CNS (see \\nch. 7) during the luteal phase.\\n \\uf0bb γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) suppresses the \\nanxiety level in the brain. Medications that are \\nGABA agonist, are effective.\\n(c) Psychological and psychosocial factors may be \\ninvolved to produce behavioral changes.\\n(d) Others: Variety of factors have been mentioned to \\nexplain the symptom complex of PMS. These are \\nthyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) prolactin, \\nrenin, aldosterone, prostaglandins, and others. \\nUnfortunately, nothing is conclusive.\\nClinical features: PMS is more common in women \\naged 30–45.

The pain usually appears following painless periods after menarche.\\n While primary dysmenorrhea occurs before the age of 20, secondary dysmenorrhea may occur at any age.\\n \\uf086 Uterine Junctional Zone (JZ) dysperistalsis and hyperactivity are the basic pathological area for primary \\ndysmenorrhea. The biochemical mediators involved are : Progesterone, PGF2α, endothelin, PAFs and leukotrienes.\\nProstaglandin synthetase inhibitors (NSAIDs) or oral contraceptives or dydrogesterone are usually effective \\nto minimise pain. Only cervical dilatation is required in obstinate cases. Secondary dysmenorrhea is almost \\nalways secondary to other pelvic pathology such as PID, endometriosis or uterine ﬁ  broids or obstruction due \\nto Mullerian malformations. \\n \\uf086 Combined oral contraceptives reduce the severity of dysmenorrhea. It is the drug of choice when contraception \\nis required. \\n \\uf086 In ovarian dysmenorrhea, the pain is referred to the area innervated by T10 to L1 segments.\\n \\uf086 Right ovarian vein syndrome is due to engorgement of right ovarian vein premenstrually so as to compress \\nthe right ureter with resultant pyelonephritis and pain.\\n \\uf086 Pain due to pelvic venous congestion is relieved by continuous high dose MPA.\\n \\uf086 Mittelschmerz’s syndrome (ovular pain) — is an indirect evidence of ovulation — occurring in the midmenstrual \\nperiod.\\n \\uf086 Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) regularly occurs in the luteal phase of each ovulatory menstrual cycle.\\nThere is no impairment of corpus luteal function for a woman who suffers from PMS. The symptoms are grouped \\ntogether and described under the name PMDD (p. 182).\\nWomen with PMDD show no deﬁ  cit in cognitive function in the luteal phase.\\nExact etiology is unknown. Altered estrogen : progesterone ratio; reduced circulatory level of neurotransmitters \\n(serotonin, GABA or endorphins) in the CNS may be responsible for the symptom complex.\\nThe symptoms are not speciﬁ  c (Table 13.3) and there is usually no abnormal pelvic ﬁ  nding.\\nThe most useful diagnostic tool for PMS is patient’s symptom diary (Table 13.3).\\nTreatment is supportive. Of the measures used in the management of PMS, beneﬁ  cial effects are observed \\nwith selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Bromocriptine is effective in relieving breast tenderness. \\nIn obstinate cases, hormones — LNG-IUS, danazol are found helpful. Results of GnRH agonist therapy are \\ndramatic. Tranquillizers (alprazolam – 0.25 mg) and/or antidepressants (ﬂ  uoxetine 20 mg daily or sertraline \\n50 mg/day) signiﬁ  cantly improve the symptoms. Oral contraceptive pills suppressing ovulation, calcium, \\naerobic exercise are helpful in relieving symptoms of PMDD.\\nIn proved cases — relief of symptoms producing amenorrhea either by danazol or GnRH analogues for 3 months \\ncan be achieved. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in patients approaching menopause may \\nbe an option.\\nCh-13.indd   184 13-11-2013   11:32:39'),\n",

The bleeding may be abnormal in \\nfrequency, amount, or duration or combination of any \\nthree. As the diagnosis is based with the exclusion \\nof ‘organic lesion’, so with the care and facilities to \\nexclude such a lesion, the incidence varies. Currently \\nDUB is defined as a state of abnormal uterine \\nbleeding following anovulation due to dysfunction of \\nhypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis (endocrine origin).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe physiological mechanism of hemostasis in \\nnormal menstruation are: (1) Platelet adhesion \\nformation. (2) Formation of platelet plug with fibrin \\nto seal the bleeding vessels. (3) Localized vaso-\\nconstriction. (4) Regeneration of endometrium. \\n(5) Biochemical mechanism involved are: In \\nincreased endometrial ratio of PGF2α/PGE2. PGF2α \\ncauses vasoconstriction and reduces bleeding.  \\nProgesterone increases the level of PGF 2α from \\narachidonic acid. Levels of endothelin,  which is \\na powerful vasoconsinctor is also increased. In \\nanovulatory DUB, there is decreased synthesis of \\nPGF2α and the ratio of PGF2α/PGE2  is low.\\nAnovulatory cycles are usually not associated with \\ndysmenorrhea as the level of PGF 2α is low. Women \\nwith menorrhagia have low level of thromboxane in \\nthe endometrium. \\nThe endometrial abnormalities may be primary or \\nsecondary to incoordination in the hypothalamo-\\npituitary-ovarian axis.

The possible \\nexplanations are :\\n (i) Incomplete withdrawal of LH even on 26th day of \\ncycle → incomplete atrophy of the corpus luteum \\n→ Persistent secretion of progesterone.\\n (ii) Persistent LH → inhibition of FSH → suppresses \\nripening of the follicle in the next cycle → Less \\nestrogen → less regeneration.\\nEndometrial sampling performed after 5th or 6th \\nday of the onset of menstruation reveals a mixture of \\nsecretory and proliferative endometrium. There is \\ntotal absence of any surface epithelium.\\nIrregular ripening of the endometrium\\nThere is poor formation and inadequate function \\nof the corpus luteum. Secretion of both estrogen and \\nprogesterone is inadequate to support the endometrial \\ngrowth. As such, slight bleeding occurs and continues \\nprior to the start of proper flow.\\nThe endocrine profile in the luteal phase shows \\npersistent low level of urinary pregnanediol level of \\nless than 3 mg or plasma progesterone level less than \\n5 ng/mL.\\nEndometrial study prior to or soon after spotting \\nreveals patchy area of secretory changes amidst \\nproliferative endometrium.\\nANOvulAR blEEDING\\n\\uf074 Menorrhagia\\nAnovular bleeding is usually excessive. In the \\nabsence of growth limiting progesterone due to \\nanovulation, the endometrial growth is under the \\ninfluence of estrogen throughout the cycle. There \\nis inadequate structural stromal support and the \\nendometrium remains fragile.\\nThus, with the withdrawal of estrogen due to \\nnegative feedback action of FSH, the endometrial \\nshedding continues for a longer period in asynchronous \\nsequences because of lack of compactness.\\n\\uf074 Cystic glandular hyperplasia \\n(Syn: Metropathia hemorrhagica, Schroeder’ s \\ndisease)\\nThis type of abnormal bleeding is usually met in \\npremenopausal women.\\nThe basic fault may lie in the ovaries or may be \\ndue to disturbance of the rhythmic secretion of the \\ngonadotropins. There is slow increase in secretion of \\nestrogen but no negative feedback inhibition of FSH. \\nThe net effect is gradual rise in the level of estrogen \\nwith concomittant phase of amenorrhea for about 6–8 \\nweeks. As there is no ovulation, the endometrium is \\nunder the influence of estrogen without being opposed \\nby growth limiting progesterone for a prolonged period. \\nAfter a variable period, however, the estrogen level falls \\nresulting in endometrial shedding with heavy bleeding. \\nBleeding also occurs when the endometrial growth \\nhave outgrown their blood supply. Due to increased \\nendometrial thickness, tissue breakdown continues \\nfor a long time. Bleeding is heavy as there is no \\nvasoconstrictor effect of PGF2α. Bleeding is prolonged \\nuntil the endometrium and blood vessels regenerate to \\ncontrol it.\\nChanges in the uterus:  There is variable degree \\nof myohyperplasia with symmetrical enlargement \\nof the uterus to a size of about 8–10 weeks due to \\nsimultaneous hypertrophy of muscles (Fig. 14.2). \\nThe endometrial changes are classical. On naked eye \\nexamination, the endometrium looks thick, congested \\nand often polypoidal (multiple polyposis).\\nMicroscopically\\n(a) There is marked hyperplasia of all the endometrial \\ncomponents.

There is no \\nevidence of corpus luteum.\\nConfusion in diagnosis: Phase of amenorrhea \\nfollowed by continued bleeding per vaginum with \\nbulky uterus is too often confused with disturbed \\nuterine pregnancy or ectopic gestation. In anovula-\\ntory DUB, unlike normal menstruation there is no \\nuniform sloughing of endometirum up to the basal \\nlayer. This results in excessive uterine bleeding. In \\nanovulatory DUB, there is decreased synthesis of \\nPGF2α (PGF2α/PGE2 is low) and thromboxane. Due to \\nthis reason, DUB of this type is absolutely painless.\\nAtrophy of the endometrium: This type of abnor-\\nmality is commonly met in postmenopausal women \\nbut may occur in reproductive period as final involu-\\ntionary state of a previous metropathia.\\nThe bleeding occurs from the rupture of the dilated \\ncapillaries beneath the atrophic surface epithelium. \\nThe cause of endometrial atrophy may be due to \\ntotal absence of estrogen or failure of uterine receptors \\nto become responsive to estrogen.\\nEndometrial Pattern in Dub\\nThe following are the histological patterns found in \\nDUB. In majority (60%), the endometrium is normal \\nsecretory in every aspect. In about 30 percent, the \\nendometrium is hyperplastic and in the remaining, \\nthere are evidences of irregular shedding, irregular \\nripening, or atrophic pattern.\\nInvestigations\\nThe investigation aims at:\\n\\uf074 To confirm the menstrual abnormality as stated  \\nby the patient.\\n\\uf074 To exclude the systemic, iatrogenic, and ‘organic’ \\npelvic pathology.\\n\\uf074 To identify the possible etiology of DUB.\\n\\uf074 To work out the definite therapy protocol.\\nHistory \\nFirstly, it is to be confirmed that the bleeding is \\nthrough the vagina and not from the urethra or rectum. \\nThe statement of excessive bleeding is assessed \\nby number of pads used, passage of clots (size and \\nnumber), and duration of bleeding. If ambiguity is \\nfound from the estimated hemoglobin percentage, it is \\nbetter to assess the blood loss by admitting the patient \\nduring period. Among the patients presenting with \\nmenorrhagia, only about 50 percent have got excess \\nblood loss (> 80 mL).\\nNature of menstrual abnormality is then to be \\nenquired—cyclic or acyclic, its relation to puberty, \\npregnancy events and last normal cycle. Any emotional \\nupset or psychosexual problem should be elicited \\ntactfully. Use of steroidal contraceptives or IUCD \\ninsertion should be enquired. History of abnormal \\nbleeding from the injury site, epistaxis, gum bleeding, \\nor that suggestive of PID should be enquired.\\nA thorough general and relevant systemic \\nexamination is to be made in an effort to find out the \\ncause or effect of abnormal bleeding.

This will pull the uterus forwards and maintains \\nit permanently in the same position.\\nPElVIC ORgaN PROlaPSE (POP)\\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is one of the common \\nclinical conditions met in day-to-day gynecological \\npractice especially among the parous women. The \\nentity includes descent of the vaginal wall and/or the \\nuterus. It is infact a form of hernia.\\nSuPPORTS  Of uTER uS\\nThe uterus is normally placed in anteverted and \\nanteflexed position. It lies in between the bladder and \\nrectum. The cervix pierces the anterior vaginal wall \\nalmost at right angle to the axis of the vagina. The \\nexternal os lies at the level of ischial spines.\\nThe uterus is held in this position and at this level \\nby supports conveniently grouped under three tier \\nsystems. The objective is to maintain the position and \\nto prevent descent of the uterus through the natural \\nurogenital hiatus in the pelvic floor (Fig. 15.4).\\n\\uf0a1 Upper tier \\nThe upper most supports of the uterus primarily \\nmaintain the uterus in anteverted position.

It is connected with the \\npubocervical ligaments and the vesicovaginal \\nseptum anteriorly, cardinal ligaments laterally and \\nthe uterosacral ligaments and the rectovaginal \\nseptum posteriorly (p. 24).\\nFunction: It stabilizes the cervix at the level of \\ninterspinous diameter along with the other ligaments.\\ny Pelvic cellular tissues—The endopelvic fascia \\nconsist of connective tissues and smooth muscles. \\nThe blood vessels and nerves supplying the uterus, \\nbladder, and vagina pass through it from the lateral \\npelvic wall. As they pass, the pelvic cellular \\ntissues condense surrounding them and give good \\ndirect support to the viscera.\\nThe endopelvic fascia at places is condensed and \\nreinforced by plain muscles to form ligaments — \\nMackenrodt’s, uterosacral, and pubocervical. On the \\nmedial side, these are attached to the pericervical \\nring covering the cervicovaginal junction and on the \\nother end are attached to the lateral, posterior, and \\nanterior walls of the pelvis (Figs 15.5 and 15.6).

It supports the \\npelvic viscera and counteracts the downward thrust of \\nincreased intra-abdominal pressure. \\nThe medial fibers of the pubococcygeus part of \\nlevator ani muscles, are attached mainly to the urethra, \\nvagina and rectum. Few fibrous pass behind the \\nrectum, vagina, and the urethra forming a sling. These \\npubovisceral fibers of the levator ani muscles squeeze \\nthe rectum, vagina, and urethra and keep them closed \\nby compressing against the pubic bone.\\nWhen the levator ani muscles are damaged, the \\npelvic floor opens and there is widening of the hiatus \\nurogenitalis.

It is a simple, safe and effective operation  \\nfor a woman who is no longer interested in coital \\nfunction.\\nSacrospinous colpopexy: The sacrospinous ligament \\nis attached medially to the sacrum and coccyx and \\nlaterally to the ischial spine. It is within the body \\nof coccygeus muscle. Vaginal vault is fixed to the \\ncoccygenus sacrospinous ligament complex (CSSL) \\nof the right side. This is done under direct vision \\nfollowing dissection of the pararectal space. A special \\nneedle (Miya hook) is used. Overall results are good.\\nComplications: Injury to the rectum, pelvic vessels \\n(internal pudendal, inferior gluteal), stress urinary \\nincontinence, gluteal pain (pudendal or sciatic nerve \\ninjury). Risk of recurrence about 3%.\\nAbdominal approach\\nVault suspension (Sacral colpopexy): Principle of \\nthe operation is to suspen the vaginal vault to be \\nanterior longitudinal ligament in front of the 3rd sacral \\nvertebra.

Retroversion perse has got no adverse effect on fertility \\nor early pregnancy.\\n h Pelvic Organ Prolapse is the prolapse of the pelvic organs into the vaginal canal. The important risk factors for \\nprolapse is history of vaginal birth and age of the woman.\\n h Important support structures of uterus are the cardinal, uterosacral, pubocervical ligaments, endopelvic fascia, \\nlevator ani muscle (pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, levator plate) and the perineal body.\\n h Prolapse is due to a combination of injury to the neuromuscular as well as supporting structures. \\n h Etiology of genital prolapse includes the anatomical factors, as well as the different clinical factors (p. 204).\\n h The hammock like arrangements of levator ani muscle, the condensed endopelvic fascia, especially the \\nMackenrodt’s ligaments are the cardinal support of the uterus. The levator plate and the perineal body maintains \\nthe normal vaginal axis (p. 201-204).\\n h Cystocele and urethrocele are more common with a gynecoid pelvis than with android or anthropoid types. \\nIn cases of congenital prolapse, occult spina bifida should be looked for. Secondary vault prolapse is more \\nfollowing vaginal hysterectomy than abdominal one. Decubitus ulcer is a trophic ulcer. Malignancy is a rare \\nassociation. Predominant urinary complaints in genital prolapse are difficulty in passing urine, incomplete \\nevacuation, frequency, stress incontinence and rarely retention. To diagnose a third degree uterine prolapse, \\ndigital palpation is mandatory. Cystocele may be confused with Gartner’s cyst. Uterine prolapse may be confused \\nwith congenital elongation of the cervix, chronic uterine inversion and fibroid polyp.\\n h The examination for prolapse should be done with the patient in dorsal position then standing and using \\nValsalva’s maneuver for correct assessment.\\n h Degree of urine prolapse: 1st degree : Uterus descends from its anatomical position but external uterine os \\nremains in the vagina; 2nd degree : External os protrudes outside the vaging but uterine body remains inside; \\n3rd degree : Uterine body descends outside the vaginal introitus (procidentia). (p. 205).\\n h Newer classifications of pelvic organ prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) have been introduced for more objective \\nquantification It is site specific and anatomical. Prolapse must be documented in terms of anterior or posterior \\nvaginal wall and the uterine descent (Table 15.2). In this regard fixed anatomic reference points are used (Fig. \\n15.10, Fig. 15.10, Table 15.6).\\n h Pessary treatment may be indicated in early pregnancy, puerperium, patient unfit for surgery or while the \\npatients are waiting for operation.\\n h The surgical procedures for the management of prolapse are different. The type of surgery for an individual \\nwoman depends on her age, parity, reproductive and sexual function and also the type and degree of prolapse \\n(Table 15.3 p. 211).\\n h The component parts of Fothergill’s operation are D + C, amputation of the cervix, plication of Mackenrodt’s \\nligaments in front of the cervix, anterior colporrhaphy and colpoperineorrhaphy (p. 216).\\n h Posthysterectomy vault prolapse (0.1–10%) is usually accompanied by an enterocele (70%). Valut prolapse can \\nbe repaired either by vaginal or by abdominal route. Colpocleisis is an easy, safe and effective method for a \\nwoman who is no longer interested in coital function.\\n h When an enterocele is present, the sac should be dissected high up and ligated at its neck to prevent recurrence. \\nMcCall culdoplasty (p. 216) is done.

Secondary infertility indicates \\nprevious pregnancy but failure to conceive subsequently.\\nFecundability is defined as the probability of achieving \\na pregnancy within one menstrual cycle. In a healthy young \\ncouple, it is 20 percent. Fecundity is the probability of \\nachieving a livebirth within a single cycle.\\ninciDence\\nEighty percent of the couples achieve conception \\nif they so desire, within one year of having regular \\nintercourse with adequate frequency (4–5 times a \\nweek). Another 10 percent will achieve the objective \\nby the end of second year. As such, 10 percent remain \\ninfertile by the end of second year.\\nFactors Essential for Conception\\n \\x99 Healthy spermatozoa should be deposited high in the \\nvagina at or near the cervix (male factor).\\n \\x99 The spermatozoa should undergo changes (capacitation, \\nacrosome reaction) and acquire motility (cervical \\nfactor).\\n \\x99 The motile spermatozoa should ascend through the \\ncervix into the uterine cavity and the fallopian tubes.\\n \\x99 There should be ovulation (ovarian factor).\\n \\x99 The fallopian tubes should be patent and the oocyte \\nshould be picked up by the fimbriated end of the tube \\n(tubal factor).\\n \\x99 The spermatozoa should fertilize  the oocyte at the \\nampulla of the tube.\\n \\x99 The embryo should reach the uterine cavity after 3–4 \\ndays of fertilization.\\n \\x99 The endometrium should be receptive (by estrogen, \\nprogesterone, IGF-l, cytokines, integrins) for \\nimplantation, and the corpus luteum should function \\nadequately.\\nPhysiological c onsiDeration\\nDue to anovulation, infertility is the rule prior to puberty \\nand after menopause. But it should be remembered that the \\ngirl may be pregnant even before menarche and pregnancy \\nis possible within few months of menopause. Conception \\nis not possible during pregnancy as the pituitary gonadal \\naxis is suppressed by hCG and hence, no ovulation. During \\nlactation, infertility is said to be relative. Despite the fact \\nthat the patient is amenorrheic during lactation, ovulation \\nand conception can occur. However, in fully lactating \\nwomen (breastfeeding 5–6 times a day and spending 60 \\nminutes in 24 hours), pregnancy is unlikely up to 10 weeks \\npostpartum.\\ncaUses of infertility\\nConception depends on the fertility potential of both \\nthe male and female partner. The male is directly \\nresponsible in about 30–40 percent, the female in \\nabout 40–55 percent and both are responsible in \\nabout 10 percent cases. The remaining 10 percent, is \\nunexplained, in spite of thorough investigations with \\nmodern technical knowhow. It is also strange that 4 \\nout of 10 patients of unexplained category become \\npregnant within 3 years without having any specific \\ntreatment.\\nIt is also emphasized that the relative subfertility \\nof one partner may sometimes be counterbalanced by \\nthe high fertility of the other.\\n'),\n",

The cause is obscure \\nbut may be associated with pelvic endometriosis or \\nwith hyperprolactinemia.\\nTubal and peritoneal factors are responsible for about \\n30–40 percent cases of female infertility. \\nThe obstruction of the tubes may be due to—\\n(a)  Pelvic infections causing: (i) Peritubal adhesions \\n(ii) Endosalpingeal damage. (b) Previous tubal surgery \\nor sterilization. (c) Salpingitis isthmica nodosa  \\n(p. 172).

The \\npossible multifactorial mechanisms which operate in \\nminimal endometriosis are depicted schematically at \\nTable 16.2.\\nUterine factors: The endometrium must be sufficiently \\nreceptive enough for effective nidation and growth of \\nthe fertilized ovum. The possible factors that hinder \\nnidation are uterine hypoplasia, inadequate secretory \\nendometrium, fibroid uterus, endometritis (tubercular \\nin particular), uterine synechiae or congenital \\nmalformation of uterus.\\nCervical factors\\nAnatomic: Anatomic defects preventing sperm \\nascent may be due to congenital elongation of the \\ncervix, second degree uterine prolapse and acute \\nretroverted uterus. These conditions prevent the \\nexternal os to bathe in the seminal pool. Pinhole os \\nmay at times be implicated, or the cervical canal may \\nbe occluded by a polyp.\\nPhysiologic: The fault lies in the composition of \\nthe cervical mucus, so much that the spermatozoa \\nfail to penetrate the mucus. The mucus may be \\nscanty following amputation, conization or deep \\ncauterization of the cervix. The abnormal constituents \\ninclude excessive, viscous or purulent discharge \\nas in chronic cervicitis.

Swim-up \\nmethod allows most motile sperm to swim-up into \\nthe supernatant. Compared to washing method it \\ncontains no dead sperm and cellular debris. About \\n0.3 mL of washed and concentrated sperm is injected \\nthrough a flexible polyethylene catheter within the \\nuterine cavity around the time of ovulation (Table \\n16.12). Washing in culture media removes the \\nproteins and prostaglandins from semen that may \\ncause uterine cramps or anaphylactoid reactions. \\nDensity gradient centrifugation recovers most \\nhighly motile as well as morphologically normal \\nsperm. The processed motile sperm count for \\ninsemination should be at least 1 million. Best \\nresults are obtained when the motile sperm count \\nexceeds 10 million. Normal sperm survive in this \\nfemale reproductive tract and can fertilize an egg for \\nat least 3 days but an oocyte survives only for 12–24 \\nhours. The procedure may be repeated 2–3 times over \\na period of 2–3 days. To increase sperm motility, \\npentoxyphylline (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) has \\nbeen used.

The incidence increases further after the age of 30 years.\\n h In fully lactating women, pregnancy is unlikely up to 10 weeks postpartum.\\n h Male factor is responsible in 30–40 percent, the female in 40–50 percent, both in 10 percent and unexplained \\nin 10 percent.\\n h Common causes of male infertility include defective spermatogenesis, obstruction of efferent duct, failure to \\ndeposit sperm high in vagina and error in seminal fluid (Table 16.1).\\n h Important causes of female infertility are tubal factor (25–35%), ovulatory factor (20–25%) and endometriosis \\n(0–10%) (Scheme 1).\\n h Ovulatory dysfunction is likely to be linked with disturbed hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis either primary \\nor secondary from thyroid or adrenal dysfunction.\\n h Luteal phase defect is observed with older women, drug induced ovulation, elevated prolactin, patients with \\nrepeated pregnancy wastage, pelvic endometriosis, DUB and subclinical hypothyroidism.\\n h Serum progesterone more than 10 ng/ml on 8th postovulatory day indicates adequate luteal function.\\n h Luteinized unruptured follicle is often associated with pelvic endometriosis or with hyperprolactinemia.\\n h Tubal factors are related to tubal infection, peritubal adhesions or endometriosis. The commonest peritoneal \\nfactor is endometriosis.\\n h Investigation of the infertile couple should be started after 1 year. The initial investigations of an infertile couple \\ninclude: semen analysis (Male factor), hysterosalpingography (tubal factor), BBT and/or serum progesterone \\n(evidence of ovulation) (Scheme 3).\\n h BBT increases when circulating level of progesterone is increased following ovulation. \\n h Diagnosis of ovulation is from indirect, direct and conclusive evidences (see Table 16.4).\\n h Subnuclear vacuolation of the endometrial glandular epithelium is the earliest evidence of ovulation  \\n(36–48 hours).\\n h A persistent rise in BBT and/or a serum progesterone more than 5 ng/m l is the presumptive evidence of \\novulation. Sonographic evidences of ovulation are collapsed follicle and fluid in the pouch of Douglas. Pregnancy \\nis the surest evidence of ovulation.\\n h A thorough investigation following an abnormal semen analysis, is needed to find out the specific cause of \\nmale infertility (Scheme 2).\\n h Tubal factor is assessed by HSG and laparoscopy; the two are complimentary. Sonohysterosalpingography has \\ngot no radiation exposure. Falloposcopy and salpingoscopy are used to study the tubal mucosa (Table 16.6).\\n h Postcoital test (PCT) is done in late proliferative phase. The examination is done 8–12 hours after coitus. The \\npresence of active motile sperm numbering at least 10 per HPF is satisfactory. Routine PCT is not recommended.\\n Presence of antisperm antibodies may not be the cause of infertility.\\n h Of all the etiological factors, greatest success is obtained following treatment of anovulation.\\n h For induction of ovulation, the commonly used drugs are clomiphene citrate, hMG, FSH, hCG, GnRH analogues, \\nbromocriptine (see Table 16.7).\\nContd...'),\n",

The incidence of \\nmiscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or congenital malformation is not increased.\\n Women with PCOS who do not ovulate cult CC, insulin sensitizers (metformin) and/or LOD (p. 247) is effective \\nin inducing ovulation.\\n h Gonadotropin therapy is indicated in cases with hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism and clomiphene failure \\n(see p. 245).\\n h GnRH is used in a pulsatile manner for cases with hypothalamic amenorrhea and hypogonadotropic \\nhypogonadism.\\n h GnRH analogues are used in patients refractory to gonadotropins, with elevated LH, with normal gonadotropins \\nor in cases with premature LH surge (see p. 246). \\n Gonadotropins and GnRH analogues and hCG are mostly used in ART with careful monitoring.\\n h Hyperprolactinemia and anovulation (5–10%) are due to inhibition of gonadotropin secretion. Serum FSH, \\nestradiol levels are low. Women suffer from oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. Bromocriptine is indicated in \\ncases of hyperprolactinemia with or without galactorrhea.\\n h Corpus luteum insufficiency can be treated by progesterone as vaginal suppositories or by hCG. LPD is currently \\nthought to be a normal biologic variant and not a true cause of infertility.\\n h Unruptured luteinized follicle is treated by intramuscular injection of hCG 5000–10,000 IU or ovulation inducing \\ndrugs, or bromocriptine if associated with hyperprolactinemia.\\n h Tuboplasty is the surgical procedure performed to restore the anatomy and physiology of the tube (Table 16.9). \\nEndoscopic surgery gives the best result. Prognosis for fertility depends upon the extent and the site of damage \\nto the tube. Tubal reconstructive surgery may be considered for mild proximal tubal block. For any complicated \\ntubal occlusive disease, IVF is the best therapy (see p. 251).\\n h Proximal tubal obstruction is usually treated by cannulation through tubes with catheters under hysteroscopic \\nvisualization. No tubal surgery should be attempted in women with pelvic tuberculosis. IVF may be considered \\nonce endometrium is free from the disease (see p. 247).\\n Overall result in terms of pregnancy following tuboplasty ranges between 15-60  percent. The pregnancy rate \\nafter salpingolysis and fimbrioplasty is about 65  percent. The result is best in reversal of tubal sterilisation by \\ntubo-tubal anastomosis (see p. 247). \\n h Any form of therapy for minimal endometriosis does not improve fertility status. Unexplained infertility is \\nobserved in about 10-15 percent cases. Women with mild endometriosis can be treated with COH (p. 239) and \\nIUI to improve fertility. \\n h Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes different methods (see Table 16.12). These are expensive and \\nneed sophisticated laboratory facilities (p. 251). \\n h The best results of IUI are obtained in the treatment of cervical factor and unexplained infertility (Table 16.10) and \\nin stimulated cycle (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation). Overall pregnancy rate ranges between 20-40  percent. \\n h Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and IUI (Table 16.11) are the options for women with unexplained \\ninfertility and for women whose male partner (husband) suffers from oligospermia. \\nContd...\\nContd...'),\n",

This condition persists only for a few days \\nuntil the level of estrogen derived from the mother \\nfalls. Thus, the congenital ectopy heals spontaneously.\\nACquIRED\\nHormonal:  The squamocolumnar junction is not \\nstatic and its movement, either inwards or outwards \\nis dependent on estrogen. When the estrogen level is \\nhigh, it moves out so that the columnar epithelium \\nextends onto the vaginal portion of the cervix \\nreplacing the squamous epithelium. This state is \\nobserved during pregnancy and amongst ‘pill \\nusers’. The squamocolumnar junction returns back to \\nits normal position after 3 months following delivery \\nand little earlier following withdrawal of ‘pill’.\\nInfection: The role of infection as the primary cause \\nof ectopy has been discarded. However, chronic \\ncervicitis may be associated or else the infection \\nmay supervene on an ectopy because of the delicate \\ncolumnar epithelium which is more vulnerable to \\ntrauma and infection.\\nPAThOgENESIS\\nIn the active phase of ectopy, the squamocolumnar \\njunction moves out from the os. The columnar \\nepithelium of the endocervix maintains its continuity \\nwhile covering the ectocervix replacing the squamous \\nepithelium. The replaced epithelium is usually \\narranged in a single layer (flat type) or may be so \\nhyperplastic as to fold inwards to accommodate in \\nthe increased area—a follicular ectopy. At times, it \\nbecomes heaped up to fold inwards and outwards— \\nA\\nB\\nfig. 18.1: (A) Normal squamocolumnar junction; (B) Ectopy\\nCh-18.indd   267 13-11-2013   17:30:45'),\n",

Underneath the \\nepithelium, there are evidences of round cell \\ninfiltration and glandular proliferation. The features of \\ninfection are probably secondary rather than primary. \\nThe columnar epithelium is less resistant to infection \\nthan the squamous epithelium.\\nDuring the process of healing, the squamocolumnar \\njunction gradually moves up towards the external \\nos. The squamous epithelium grows beneath the \\ncolumnar epithelium until it reaches at or near to its \\noriginal position at the external os. Alternatively, the \\nreplacement is probably by squamous metaplasia \\nof the columnar cells. The possibility of squamous \\nmetaplasia of the reserve cells is also likely (details \\nin Chapter 22).\\nDuring the process, the squamous epithelium may \\nobstruct the mouth of the underlying glands (normally \\nnot present in ectocervix) → pent up secretion → \\nretention cyst → Nabothian follicle. Alternatively, \\nthe epithelium may burrow inside the gland lumina. \\nThis process of replacement by the squamous \\nepithelium is called epidermidization.\\nCLINICAL  fEATuRES\\nSymptoms: The lesion may be asymptomatic. \\nHowever, the following symptoms may be present.\\n \\x99 Vaginal discharge—The discharge may be \\nexcessively mucoid.

These \\nthickened tissues tend to push out through the external \\nos along the direction of least resistance. The entity \\nis most marked where the cervix has already been \\nlacerated. In such conditions, the longitudinal muscle \\nfibers are free to act unopposed. As a result, the lips \\nof the cervix curl upwards and outwards to expose \\nthe red looking endocervix so as to be confused with \\nectopy (Figs 18.3).\\nCERVICAL TEAR\\nVarying degrees of cervical tear is invariable during \\nvaginal delivery. One or both the sides may be torn \\nor the tear may be irregular (stellate type). If there is \\nno superimposed infection and the tear is small, the \\ntorn surfaces may appose leaving behind only a small \\nnotch. However, if infection supervenes, eversion \\noccurs confusing the diagnosis of ectopy (Figs 18.3).\\nNon-obstetric causes of cervical lacerations are \\nduring operative procedures of dilatation of the \\ncervix. Postmenopausal atrophy or chronic cervicitis \\npredisposes to tear.\\nCERVICAL CYSTS\\nNAbOThIAN  CYSTS (fIg. 18.4): These are usually \\nmultiple. They are formed due to blocking of the \\ncervical gland mouths usually as a result of healing \\nof ectopy (epidermidization).

The incidence of symptomatic fibroid varies from 3–10 percent. It is \\ncommon in nulliparous and the prevalence is highest between 35–45 years.\\n Fibroid arises from the smooth muscle elements of the myometrium, could be genetically determined and the \\ngrowth is dependent on the polypeptide growth factors (EGF, IGF-1, TGF) and estrogen. It is slow growing \\ncompared to ovarian neoplasm.\\n Fibroids may affect the reproductive outcome adversely by enlargement and distortion of the uterus, anovulation \\ncervical or cornual black or poor endometrial vascularity.\\n h Corporeal fibroid is common and often multiple. All fibroids are interstitial but later on become submucous or \\nsubserous. Cervical fibroid is rare (1–2%).\\n Fibroid has got a false capsule formed by the compressed myometrium. The center is least vascular and \\ndegeneration is common.\\n Hyaline degeneration is the commonest secondary change and sarcoma is rare 0.1 percent. Red degeneration \\noccurs mainly in pregnancy and puerperium.\\n Associated endometriosis and adenomyosis is found in 30 percent and pelvic infection in 15 percent.\\n Majority of fibroids remain asymptomatic (75%). Menorrhagia is the classic symptom of fibroid. Pelvic \\nexamination is supportive—the tumor of uterine origin. For confirmation of diagnosis, the help of sonography, \\nlaparoscopy, hysteroscopy or HSG or rarely CT, MRI may be useful in selected cases.\\n Life-threatening complications include—severe anemia, intraperitoneal hemorrhage from ruptured veins over \\nthe subserous fibroid, severe infection and sarcomatous changes.\\n There is definite place of observation in asymptomatic fibroid provided one is certain of diagnosis and follow-\\nup is possible.\\n h Medical management aims mostly as palliative and the drugs used are antiprogesterones, danazol, GnRH \\nanalogs (agonists and antagonists) and LNG-IUS. Benefits of preoperative GnRH analog therapy are many \\n(see Table 19.8).\\n The surgical treatment of fibroid may be hysterectomy or myomectomy, depending upon the age of the \\npatient and need for preservation of reproductive function. Indications of myomectomy may be either due to \\na symptomatic or due to an asymptomatic fibroid (see Table 19.10). Contraindications must be carefully judged \\n(Table 19.12).\\n Laparoscopic or hysteroscopic procedures can be done with reduced morbidity.\\n Myomectomy is a risky operation. Prior to myomectomy, there are many important considerations (Table 19.9). \\nThere is chance of recurrence (30–50%), persistence of menorrhagia (1–5%) and relaparotomy (20–25%). Pregnancy \\nrate following myomectomy is about 40–60 percent. Subserous and interstitial fibroids could be removed \\nlaparoscopically. Hysteroscopic resection of the submucous fibroid can be done in selected cases (Fig. 19.8).\\n Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) and myolysis are the other methods of treatment (p. 283). The newest \\nmodality of management is uterine artery embolization which is an ambulatory and nonsurgical management.\\n h The commonest type of benign uterine polyp is a mucous one. Risk factors for polyps are: hormone replacement \\ntherapy, tamoxifen therapy or increased patient age (p. 285). A big polyp may be confused with chronic \\nuterine inversion or may be associated with it. Malignant transformation of endometrial polyps is about 0.5%. \\nHysteroscopic removal of endometrial polyps is superior to blind avulsion.\\n \\x9d Associated with chronic uterine inversion—\\nThe incision is made close to the fibroid and to \\nenucleate it.\\nWhen hysterectomy is indicated , the polyps of \\nsuch type are expected to be infected and are to be \\nremoved first. Antibiotics are to be administered. The \\ngeneral condition of the patient is to be improved and \\nhysterectomy should be done at a later date.\\nThe polyps should be sent for histological \\nexamination after its removal.'),\n",

Outflow tract \\nobstruction is an important cause when it is seen in \\nteenagers (10%). \\nsymptoms\\n\\uf073 About 25 percent of patients with endometriosis \\nhave no symptom, being accidentally discovered \\neither during laparoscopy or laparotomy.\\n\\uf073 Symptoms are not related with extent of lesion. \\nEven when the endometriosis is widespread, \\nthere may not be any symptom; conversely, \\nthere may be intense symptoms with minimal \\nendometriosis.\\n\\uf073 Depth of penetration is more related to symptoms \\nrather than the spread. Lesions penetrating more \\nthan 5 mm are responsible for pain, dysmenorrhea \\nand dyspareunia.\\n\\uf073 Non-pigmented endometriotic lesions compared \\nto the classic pigmented “powder burns” lesions \\nproduce more prostaglandin F (PGF) and hence \\nare more painful.\\n\\uf073 The symptoms are mostly related to the site of \\nlesion and its ability to respond to hormones. \\nMidline lesions are more symptom producing. \\nDegree of pain is not related to the severity of \\nendometriosis.\\nDysmenorrhea (70%)\\nThere is progressively increasing secondary \\ndysmenorrhea. The pain starts a few days prior to \\nmenstruation; gets worsened during menstruation \\nand takes time, even after cessation of period, to get \\nrelief of pain, (co-menstrual dysmenorrhea). Pain \\nusually begins after few years pain-free menses. \\nThe site of pain is usually deep seated and on the \\nback or rectum.\\nIncreased secretion of PGF 2α, thromboxane β 2 \\nfrom endometriotic tissue is the cause of pain.\\nAbnormal menstruation (20%):  Menorrhagia is \\nthe predominant abnormality. If the ovaries are also \\ninvolved, polymenorrhea or epimenorrhagia may be \\npronounced. There may be premenstrual spotting.\\nInfertility (40–60%): Whether endometriosis causes \\ninfertility or infertility produces endometriosis is \\nnot clear. Endometriosis is found in 20–40 percent \\nof infertile women, where as in about 40–50 percent \\npatients with endometriosis suffer from infertility. The \\nmultiple factors involved in producing infertility have \\nbeen depicted in p. 231 (Table 16.2).\\nDyspareunia (20–40%)\\nThe dyspareunia is usually deep. It may be due to \\nstretching of the structures of the pouch of Douglas or \\ndirect contact tenderness. As such, it is mostly found \\nin endometriosis of the rectovaginal septum or pouch \\nof Douglas and with fixed retroverted uterus.\\nChronic Pelvic Pain\\nThe pain varies from pelvic discomfort, lower \\nabdominal pain or backache. The cause may be \\nmultifactorial. These include—(i) Inflammation in \\nthe peritoneal implants and release of PGF, and also \\ndue to adhesions and ovarian cysts. (ii) Action of \\ninflammatory cytokines released by the macrophages. \\n(iii) Invasion of nerves or involvement of bladder and \\nbowel. The pain aggravates during period.\\nAbdominal Pain\\nThere may be variable degrees of abdominal pain \\naround the periods.

Pelvic endo-\\nmetriosis co-exists in about 40 percent.\\nPAthogEnEsis: Histologically, it is characterized \\nby the extension of endometrial glands and stroma \\nbeneath the endometrial—myometrial interface \\n(EMI). As the submucosa is absent, endometrial \\nglands lie in direct contact with the underlying \\nmyometrium. It forms nests, deep within myometrium. \\nSubsequently, threre is myometrial hyperplasia around \\nthe endometriotic foci. Myometrial zone anatomy \\nwas observed by MRI. A junctional zone (with low \\nsignal intensity on T2 weighted images) is defined \\nat the innermost layer of myometrium. It is thought \\nthat the disturbance of normal junctional zone (JZ) \\npredisposes to secondary infiltration of endometrial \\nglands and stroma to inner myometrial zone. The \\ndisturbance of junctional zone (JZ) may be due to the \\nendometrial factors, genetic predisposition or altered \\nimmune response. Trauma to the deeper endometrium \\n(repeated curettage), causing breakdown of EMI is \\nalso taken as an important etiologic factor. \\nPAthoLogy: The growth and tissue reaction in the \\nendometrium depend on the response of the ectopic \\nendometrial tissues to the ovarian steroids.

In adenomyosis \\nwith distorsion of junctional zone myometrial con- \\ntractions are abnormal and inadequate (see below).\\nDysmenorrhea (30%)—Progressively increased \\ncolicky pain during period is due to retrograde pattern \\nof uterine contractions. It also depends on the number \\nand depth of adenomyotic foci in the myometrium. \\nWhen the depth of penetration is > 80% of the \\nmyometrium, the pain is severe. Other causes of pain \\nare—local tissue edema and prostaglandins.\\nDyspareunia or frequency of urination—are due \\nto enlarged and tender uterus.\\nInfertility:  Women with adenomyosis have a \\nhigher incidence of infertility and miscarriage. The \\nreasons are: (a) abnormal function of the subendo-\\nmetrial myometrium, (b) retrograde myometrial \\ncontractions, (c) interference in sperm transport and \\nblastocyst implantation and (d) abnormal endomerial \\nimmune respose and nitric oxide level.\\nsigns:  Abdominal examination may reveal \\na hypogastric mass arising out of the pelvis and \\noccupying the midline.

Endometriosis is a disease seen in the reproductive years of a woman as its growth depends on \\nestrogen. The incidence is about 10 percent but incidence is high (30–40%) amongst infertile women as based \\non diagnostic laparoscopy and laparotomy.  The commonest abdominal site is ovary followed by pouch of \\nDouglas and uterosacral ligaments (organs on the dependent part of the pelvis).\\n h Endometriosis is a disease of contrast. It is a benign disease but it is locally invasive, disseminates widely and \\nproliferates in the lymph nodes. Minimal disease may have severe pain whereas large endometriosis may remain \\nasymptomatic. Cyclic hormones stimulates growth whereas continuous hormones suppress it.\\n h Abdominal scar is the commonest site of endometriosis following hysterectomy, hysterotomy, cesarean section, \\ntubectomy or myomectomy (Fig. 21.5).\\n h The disease is full of theories and no one single theory can explain endometriosis at all sites. Genetic basis \\nand defect of local cellular immunity may be implicated (Table 21.2). In spite of dense adhesions amongst the \\npelvic structures, the fallopian tubes are usually patent. In pelvic endometriosis, typically there are small black \\ndots—‘powder burns’ or “gunshot“ seen on uterosacral ligaments and pouch of Douglas. Other lesions are \\nflame-shaped polypoidal, hemorrhagic and white patches.\\n h About 25 percent have got no symptom. Symptoms are not related to the extent of lesion. Severity of \\nendometriosis and the degree of pelvic pain are not always proportional. Unlike primary dysmenorrhea, the \\npain lasts for many days before and after the menstruation.\\n h Dysmenorrhea is associated in 50 percent, menorrhagia in 60 percent and infertility in 40–60 percent. \\nEndometriosis is found in 30–40 percent of infertile women.\\n h Clinical diagnosis is by the classic symptoms of progressively increasing dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, infertility \\nand feel of nodules in the pouch of Douglas. Confirmation is by laparoscopy or laparotomy.\\n h Histologic diagnosis of endometriosis is ideal. Microscopic diagnostic features are: presence of endometrial \\nglands, stroma and hemosiderin-laden macrophages.\\n h Double puncture laparoscopy is considered the ‘gold standard’ for the diagnosis.\\n h The natural course of the disease is ill understood. It is progressive in about 30–60 percent patients and for the \\nremainder it is either static or resolve spontaneously. Unfortunately, it is impossible to predict in which patient \\nit will progress. Red blood filled lesions are the most active phase of endometriosis. Serum marker CA 125 is \\nhelpful in follow up cases of proved endometriosis.\\nContd...'),\n",

These combined factors along \\nwith endocrinopathy (Table 21.3) may be responsible for infertility. However, the association of minimal to \\nmild endometriosis and infertility is controversial.\\n h The complications include endocrinopathy (LPD, anovulation, LUF or elevated prolactin level) rupture chocolate \\ncyst, infection of the cyst or obstructive features (intestinal or ureteric). \\n Other complications of endometriosis are: Acute abdomen due to rupture of chocolate cyst, infection of the \\ncyst, colorectal obstruction and ureteral obstruction.\\n h The short-term goals of treatment for endometriosis are : (i) relief of pain and (ii) improvement of fertility. The \\nlong-term goal is to prevent progression or recurrence of the disease.\\n h Expectant treatment is extended to unmarried or young married with no abnormal pelvic findings. Endometriosis \\ncauses pelvic inflammation. So the drugs used are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or \\nprostaglandin synthetase inhibitors.\\n h The hormonal treatment should be considered suppressive rather than curative. The mechanism of atrophy \\ncan be explained by pseudopregnancy or by pseudomenopause or by medical hypophysectomy (see p. 311). \\nThe commonly used hormones are given in the Table 21.6.\\n The objective of medical therapy is to create amenorrhea (hypoestrogenic state). Aromatase inhibitors (letrozol \\n2.5 mg daily) are used to inhibit aromatase which converts androgens to estrogens. Estrogen promotes its growth \\n(p. 310, 531). The overall fertility rate and the recurrence rate is about 40 percent.\\n h The effect of danazol is by its ‘pseudomenopause’ response. The side effects are due to its androgenic and \\nanabolic properties (see p. 530). GnRH agonists produce ‘Medical oophorectomy’ and the side effects are due \\nto the estrogen deprivation (see p. 525). ‘Add back’ therapy is suggested with chronic use of GnRH agonists.\\n h Conservative surgery in endometriosis includes removal of all macroscopic endometriosis, lysis of adhesions \\nand restoration of normal pelvic anatomy. The surgery is preferably done by laparoscopy (diathermy, laser \\nvaporization). Endoscopic laser surgery is the best in selected cases for the treatment of pain and to prevent \\nthe disease progress.\\n h Ovarian endometriosis (< 3 cm) is treated by laparoscopic cyst aspiration. The cyst wall is vaporized to destroy \\nthe mucosal lining. Large ovarian endometrioma (> 3 cm) is treated by laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. \\nLaparoscopic adhesiolysis should be done at the same time. Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy improves fertility.\\n h Preoperative medical treatment with GnRH analogue may reduce the vascularity and the extent of the disease.\\nPostoperative medical treatment should not prevent pregnancy as the chance of pregnancy is highest during \\nthe first 6–12 months after the conservative surgery.\\n h Definitive surgery includes total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Laparotomy is done for \\nadvanced stage disease or in women who has completed her family.\\n h Postoperative estrogen replacement therapy after total hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy may be given \\n3 months after surgery. The risk of recurrence is very low.\\n h Adenomyosis primarily occurs in parous women over the age of 35. Adenomyosis is associated with pelvic \\nendometriosis in 40 percent. Menorrhagia (70%) and dysmenorrhea are the chief complaints. Uterus is diffusely \\nenlarged (2–3 times). Uterine size > 14 weeks gestation is rare.\\n Hormone treatment is often ineffective.

Two mechanisms \\nare involved in the process of replacement of endocer-\\nvical columnar epithelium by squamous epithelium.\\n ♦ By squamous metaplasia of the subcolumnar \\nreserve cells (Fig. 22.2).\\n ♦ Squamous epidermidization by ingrowth of the \\nsquamous epithelium of the ectocervix under the \\ncolumnar epithelium.\\nInitially, the squamous cells are immature but \\nultimately become mature and indistinguishable to \\nthe adjacent squamous epithelium.\\nThis metaplastic process is very active at the time \\nof menarche and during and after first pregnancy. \\nThese periods are of high estrogenic phase which \\nlowers the vaginal pH. The acid pH probably is an \\nimportant trigger for the metaplastic process. This \\nmetaplastic cells have got the potentiality to undergo \\natypical transformation by trauma or infection.\\nThe prolonged effect of carcinogens can produce \\ncontinuous changes in the immature cells which may \\nlead to malignancy. Early age sexual activity and \\nmultiple sexual partners are the most consistent risk \\nfactors. HPV infection is transmitted through sexual \\nactivity. Microtrauma (sexual intercourse) causes \\nviral entry to the epithelium (basal or parabasal cells) \\nof the transformation zone adjacent to the SCJ.

Cells are spread on a single slide and \\nfixed immediately (see p. 111).\\n(i) Dyskaryotic cells (see p. 112) are atypical cells with \\nhyperchromatic large nuclei having abundant cytoplasm \\n(Fig. 22.5).\\n(ii) Carcinoma-in-situ cells contain hyperchromatic nuclei, \\ncoarse chromatin and lesser cytoplasm. There may be \\nmultiple nuclei and abnormal mitotic figures (Table 22.4).\\nMild dyskaryotic smear is correlated with CIN II/III \\nlesion in about 50 percent of cases. Severe dyskaryosis is \\ncorrelated with about 90 percent of CIN II/III (Table 22.6).\\n\\uf0be\\u2002HPV-DNA testing is useful in cervical scre- \\nening: Hybrid capture method can reliably detect \\nthe high risk HPV types within hours. However, only \\nabout 2–5 percent of women diagnosed with HPV \\nDNA will ever develop CIN. Nearly 80 percent test \\npositive women will clear the infection (HPV) by \\ntheir own immune defense.

It has been estimated that about \\n25 percent of adenomatous hyperplasia, 50 percent of \\natypical hyperplasia and 100 percent of carcinoma-in-\\nsitu will develop endometrial carcinoma, if left untreated.\\nETIOLOGy\\nEndometrial hyperplasia develops in women of 40–50 \\nyears. Amongst numerous factors, unopposed estrogen \\nappears to be the primary factor. Pre-menopausal \\npersistent anovulation is almost a constant factor. In \\nthe postmenopausal women with obesity, peripheral \\nconversion of androgens into estrogen is a risk \\nfactor.

The acid pH is probably an important trigger \\nfor the metaplastic process. This metaplastic cells can undergo atypical transformation by trauma or infection, \\nif the host response is poor.\\n \\uf086 The exact cause of CIN is unknown. HPV infection is an increased risk factor. Human papilloma virus (HPV) \\ntypes having high oncogenic risk are: 16, 18, 31, 33, 58 and 68. Not all women with HPV infection progress to \\nCIN and HPV infection may regress (80%) spontaneously.\\n HPV vaccines against HPV types 16, 18 (Bivalent) or HPV types 16, 18, 6, 11 (Quadrivalent) are effective  in \\nprevention of 90% of cervical cancer. Vaccines are given to girls aged 12–18 years in three doses. Both the \\nvaccines have some cross protection against HPV types 31, 33 and 45. Vaccines are type speciﬁ  c and effective \\nonly when given prophylactically (see p. 326). Vaccines are safe and well-tolerated.\\n \\uf086 The risk of progression of CIN to invasive carcinoma is variable. The risk of malignant progression is lowest \\nwith CIN I—1 percent, moderate with CIN II—5 percent and highest with CIN III—20 percent. It is indeed \\ndifﬁ  cult to ascertain which type of CIN and with what time CIN lesions will proceed to invasive carcinoma. \\nCIN should be observed as it usually regresses spontaneously.\\n \\uf086 The mean age of CIN is about 30 years. Some of the documented risk factors are early sexual intercourse, early \\nage of ﬁ  rst pregnancy, too many and too frequent births, low socioeconomic status, multiple sexual partners, \\nimmunosuppressed (HIV positive) individuals, STD, husband whose previous wife died of cervical malignancy, \\noral pill users, smoking habits, etc.\\n \\uf086 Cytologic and colposcopic ﬁ  ndings are aids to the diagnosis but biopsy is only conﬁ  rmatory.\\n \\uf086 The triage strategy (see p. 323) includes Pap smear test (see p. 110) → atypical smear → HPV DNA assay using \\nhybroid capture 2 → High-risk HPV → Colposcopy (see p. 324). This strategy eliminates the need for unnecessary \\ncolposcopic examinations and also frequently repeated Pap smears, when it is negative.\\n \\uf086 Colposcopy is the examination of the cervix with magniﬁ  cation (6–16 times). Colposcopy is done when the Pap \\nsmear is abnormal. Biopsy is indicated when the colposcopic ﬁ  ndings (see p. 324) are abnormal. Conization of \\nthe cervix (p. see 589) is performed when there is any discrepancy of cytology, colposcopy and biopsy reports.\\n \\uf086 CIN 1 should be observed rather than treated as it regresses spontaneously. LLETZ (LEEP) is used to treat \\nCIN 2 AND 3. Cone excision should be done to detect cervical glandular disease as cytology and colposcopy \\nare not reliable.\\n The aim of therapy is to destroy all the abnormal (CIN) areas. Cryotherapy, cold coagulation, Electrodiathermy, \\nLaser and LLETZ all can destroy the lesion. In cases with completed family, hysterectomy is the preferred \\ntreatment. In conservative surgery, long-term follow-up should be done. \\n Microinvasive carcinoma requires a conization specimen. Conization is as effective as hysterectomy for CIN, \\nprovided the cone margins are free of disease.\\n \\uf086 Follow up of patients treated for CIN is cytology at 6 months and then repeated at 12 months. Thereafter cytology \\nis repeated at 3 yearly intervals. The risk of recurrence of CIN following initial therapy is about 3–5 percent.\\n \\uf086 CIN lesions detected during pregnancy needs to be evaluated in puerperium as such a lesion may regress \\nspontaneously.\\n \\uf086 The premalignant endometrial lesions include simple hyperplasia, complex hyperplasia, atypical simple \\nhyperplasia and atypical complex hyperplasia (WHO). In young patients with cystic or glandular hyperplasia, \\ncyclic progestogen therapy for 6–9 months may be helpful. If regression fails to occur or in perimenopausal \\nwomen, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be done.\\n Atypical hyperplasia in peri or postmenopausal women is considered for hysterectomy.\\n \\uf086 VAIN is associated with CIN in 70% of cases.\\n \\uf086 VAIN is caused by oncogenic HPV.

Presumably, it \\nshould include those lesions which have got minimal \\nmorbidity and deaths with the best available therapy \\nand a maximal 5-year survival rate. With these criteria, \\nthe following stages as per FIGO classification are \\nincluded in the category of early carcinoma.\\nStage 5-year survival rate (%)\\nia1 98.7\\nia2 95.9\\nib1 90.4\\nib2 79.8\\ntablE 23.8  Early carciNoMa\\nThus all these have got 5-year survival rates \\nranging between 80-100 percent. Stage II reduces \\nthe 5-year survival rate to as low as 55–70 percent. \\nAs such, it is inappropriate to include any lesion \\nextending beyond the cervix as early carcinoma.\\nAs the presentation of the case differs, these are \\ngrouped as:\\n♦ Preclinical ♦ Clinical\\nPreclinical\\nThere may not be any symptom nor any pelvic finding \\nto raise any suspicion. The cervix may look apparently \\nhealthy. The diagnosis is made by the following:\\n x Incidental on histological examination of tissues \\nremoved by biopsy, portio amputation or removal \\nof the uterus.\\n x During screening procedures.\\nCytologically suspicious smear is subjected to \\ncolposcopy followed by directed biopsy. In the \\nabsence of colposcopy, Schiller’s test directed biopsy \\nis to be taken. If a positive lesion is found, diagnostic \\nconization has to be done and subjected to serial \\nsections. Depending upon the degree of neoplastic \\nchanges and/or its invasion to the adjacent stroma, \\nthe lesions are diagnosed as follows:\\n♦ Stage 0 ♦ Stage Ia ♦ Stage Ib\\nStage 0 \\nThe neoplastic changes involve whole thickness of the \\nepithelium but the basement membrane remains \\nintact.\\nStage Ia (microinvasive carcinoma)\\nMicroinvasive carcinoma is one which is predo-\\nminantly intraepithelial carcinoma, except that there \\nis disruption of the basement membrane. The \\nneoplastic epithelium invades the stroma in one or \\nmore places but limited up to 5 mm from the overlying \\nbasement membrane. As such, the depth of invasion \\nis measured by using a microscope with an ocular \\nmicrometer.\\nThe malignant cells maintain their connection with \\nthe overlying intraepithelial neoplasm. The cords of \\nmalignant cells may become confluent or invade the \\nlymphovascular channels, irrespective of depth of \\npenetration.\\nThe mean age is 38–42 years.\\nIn majority, the entity is asymptomatic. There \\nmay be blood stained discharge, intermenstrual, \\npostcoital or postmenopausal bleeding. The cervix \\nmay look abnormal like erosion, eversion or cervicitis.\\nThe diagnosis is made only on cone biopsy \\nof the cervix.  Initial screening may be done with \\ncytology, colposcopy and directed biopsy along with \\nendocervical curettage.\\nThe patient with microinvasive carcinoma may be \\ntreated even with conservative surgery when there is \\nno risk of lymph node metastasis.\\nStage Ib: The invasion of the malignant cells to the \\nunderlying stroma exceeds 5 mm.

Even when the \\ninvasive carcinoma is detected, it is so early that a \\n85–100 percent 5-year survival rate could be achieved.\\nDownstaging screening (Who 1986) \\nDownstaging for cervical cancer is defined as “the \\ndetection of the disease at an earlier stage when \\nit is still curable.

In the developing \\ncountries, where effective mass screening cannot \\nbe extended and the majority of cases of carcinoma \\ncervix are diagnosed at an advanced stage, ‘down \\nstaging screening’ offers at least an early detection \\nof disease. Compared to cytological screening it is \\nsuboptimal. But in places where prevalence of cancer \\nis high and cytological screening is not available, \\n“downstaging screening” is useful. The strategy is, \\nhowever, not expected to lower the incidence of \\ncancer cervix, but it can certainly minimize the \\ncancer death through early detection.\\nDownstaging procedure: A female primary health \\ncare worker is trained for 2–3 weeks to perform \\nspeculum examination.

Tight vaginal pack soaked in \\nMonsel’s solution (Ferric Subsulfate) against the cervix \\nmay control bleeding temporarily.\\nPain: Palliation of pain is done either by reducing the pain \\nstimulus or by raising the pain threshold. Pain from bone \\nmetastasis is mainly due to prostaglandin production. It is \\nbest controlled by using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory \\ndrugs (NSAIDs). Palliative radiation with 2000 cGy over \\nfive treatment course may be an alternative. Anxiolytic \\n(benzodiazepines) or antidepressant drugs (amitriptyline) \\nmay be helpful to raise the pain threshold.

If it \\noccurs earlier to that, it is presumed that the carcinoma was \\npresent at the time of primary surgery and, as such it is called \\ncoincidental, residual or false stump carcinoma.\\nThe incidence may be as high as 1 percent. It is difficult \\nto stage the disease. \\nThere is also difficulty in the treatment. Dense adhesions \\nof bladder, rectum and also ureters with the stump make the \\noperation difficult and risky. The radiation therapy is also \\ntechnically difficult, because of absence of uterus and close \\nproximity of bladder and rectum to the radiation source. \\nRadical parametrectomy, removal of cervix, upper vagina \\nand pelvic lymphadenectomy is done in early stage disease.\\nExternal beam radiation therapy is given when the cervix \\nis short. Vaginal radium application (vaginal cone) is also \\nused. The prognosis is unfavorable.

In India, it ranks third amongst genital malignancy \\nnext to cervix and ovary. \\nWhile in the Western countries, there has been \\nincreased incidence of carcinoma body relative to \\ncervical one and the ratio becomes almost 1:1; in \\nIndia, the incidence still remains low and the ratio \\nranges between 1:8 and 1:15. The high prevalence \\nof cancer cervix is due to infection with HPV\\n(p. 323) in presence of other cofactors (p. 322) and \\nlack of screening facilities (see p. 324).\\nThe higher incidence in the Western countries \\nmay be real or apparent.

It should be \\nremembered that it is not a tumor of the uterus which \\nis secondarily involved.\\nAbout 3–5 percent of all patients with molar \\npregnancies develop choriocarcinoma. Amongst \\nall patients with choriocarcinoma, around 50 \\npercent develop following a hydatidiform mole, \\n30 percent occur after a miscarriage or an ectopic \\npregnancy and 20 percent after an apparently normal \\npregnancy. Trophoblastic disease following a \\nnormal pregnancy is either choriocarcinoma or \\nPSTT and not a benign or invasive mole.\\nPaTHoLogy: The primary site is usually anywhere in \\nthe uterus.

It looks \\nred, hemorrhagic and necrotic. At times, the lesion is \\ndiffuse involving the entire endometrium. The nodular \\ntype may be located deep in the myometrium with \\noverlying endometrium intact. This often gives the \\nfalse-negative diagnosis on uterine curettage.\\nMicroscopic appearance (fig. 23.15) \\nThere are anaplastic sheets or columns of tropho-\\nblastic cells invading the uterine musculature.

The nonepithelial malignant \\ntumors such as gonadal stromal or germ cell tumors \\nare indeed rare, present special problems in extremes \\nof age and are of pathologist’s curiosity. These will \\nbe dealt separately. Thus, in the discussion to \\nfollow, only the malignant epithelial tumors will \\nbe described.\\nPrimary epithelial: Malignant epithelial tumors \\ninclude both cystic and solid types. These are \\nbilateral in about 50 percent (Fig. 23.24). Cystic is \\nmore common than solid. These may arise de novo \\nas malignant or more commonly, they result from \\nmalignant changes of benign cystic tumors.\\nEndometrioid carcinoma is associated with \\nendometrial carcinoma in 20 percent and ovarian \\nendometriosis in 10 percent cases. In less than 5 \\npercent, it may arise from the endometrial cyst.\\ncystic\\nNaked eye appearances: The wall of the cystic tumor \\nbecomes shaggy. There may be papillary projection at \\nplaces. Cut section shows solid areas with hemorrhage \\nat places. The papillae become friable, the base \\nbecomes broad and indurated. In mucinous type, it is \\nfilled up with gelatinous material (Fig. 23.20).\\nEPiDEMiology\\nHighest incidence is recorded in the industrialized countries \\n(Sweden, USA and UK). There is significant reduction \\nin the risk with increasing parity. Nulligravidas carry a \\nhigher risk for ovarian malignancy. Incessant ovulation \\ntheory (Fathalla, 1971) suggests repeated ovulatory trauma \\nto the ovarian epithelial lining is a promoting factor for \\ncarcinogenesis. Combined oral contraceptive pills reduce \\nthe risk significantly as also repeated pregnancies. The \\nrole of ovulation inducing drugs is yet uncertain. Use of \\ncoffee, tobacco, alcohol and dietary fat has been implicated. \\nAssociation of ovarian cancer with talc and asbestos has \\nalso been mentioned. Breastfeeding, tubal ligation and \\nhysterectomy have been associated with reduction in the risk.gENEtics  aND ovariaN MaligNaN cy\\nHereditary ovarian cancer occurs in two forms: \\n(i) Hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome  \\n(BOC) is observed in 80–95 percent cases of all \\nfamilial ovarian cancers. BRCA1 (chromosome \\n17q) and BRCA2 (chromosome 13q) gene mutations \\nare observed in majority of such cases (serous not \\nmucinous carcinoma). These patients present at an \\nearlier age.\\n (ii) Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer \\n(HNPCC)—is an autosomal dominant transmission. \\nWomen with HNPCC (Lynch II syndrome) have life \\ntime risk of about 50% for endometrial cancer and \\n12% for ovarian cancer. The risks of other cancers \\nlike genitourinary in addition to HNPCC are high. It is \\ndue to mutations in three DNA mismatch repair genes \\n(MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6). However, majority of epithelial ovarian cancers are \\nnot familial or hereditary.

Increased \\nneoangiogenesis in ovarian malignancy causes central \\nneovascularity. Study of vascular parameters, e.g. \\nPulsatility Index (PI) < 1.0 or Resistive Index (RI) < \\n0.4 increases the risk of malignancy.\\nRecently three dimensional, contrast enhanced, \\npower Doppler sonography is found to be more \\ndiagnostic.\\n� Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI): RMI =  \\nU × M × CA 125; U = USG score (one point each for \\n: multi-locular cyst; solid areas; metastasis; ascites; \\nbilateral lesions), M = 3 (postmenopausal women) \\nand CA-125 level in U/mL.

The tumor may be typical or atypical (Krukenberg). The primary sites of Krukenberg \\nare stomach, large bowel and breast. The spread to the ovaries is by retrograde lymphatics. Histologically, it is \\nconﬁ  rmed by presence of ‘signet ring’ looking cells.\\n \\uf086 Patients with familial cancer syndrome (Lynch type I and II) have a higher risk of developing epithelial ovarian \\ncancer. Mutations of BRCA 1 gene (17 q) and BRCA II gene (13 q) have been observed. Inherited ovarian \\nmalignancies account for about 5 percent of epithelial ovarian cancers (see p. 371).\\n \\uf086 The efficacy of screening procedure is not well-documented. However, periodic internal examination \\nsupplemented by transvaginal color Doppler sonography to note the ovarian volume, blood ﬂ  ow and estimation \\nof CA-125 in ‘high risk’ population, can reveal the lesion at the early stage. Gene mutation study for detection \\nof genetic inheritance is not currently recommended.\\nHigh-risk women are : family history of ovarian, endometrial or breast carcinoma, history of removal of ovarian \\nor breast neoplasm, presence of pelvic tumor in adolescent and perimenopausal women and postmenopausal \\npalpable ovary (volume > 8 cm3).\\nProtective factors for ovarian epithelial adenocarcinomas are: combined oral contraceptives, pregnancy, tubal \\nligation, hysterectomy and breastfeeding.\\nOvarian enlargement less than 8 cm in diameter in a menstruating women is most commonly functional.\\nSurgery is the keystone in the primary treatment of ovarian malignancy. The aims are staging of the disease \\nand to perform maximum surgical removal.\\nThe ideal deﬁ  nitive surgery is total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with infracolic \\nomentectomy with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node sampling. In exceptional cases, conservative surgery of \\nunilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is justiﬁ  ed.\\nDebulking surgery with residual tumor nodules < 1 cm confers better survival advantage even in advanced \\nstage disease. CT, MRI and PET are effective for detecting residual tumor and the retroperitoneal nodes.\\nSecond look surgery either by laparoscopy or laparotomy is employed either after 12 courses of chemotherapy \\nor after 1 year of primary therapy.\\nThe 5-year survival rate for patients with borderline epithelial ovarian cancer (grade 0) is close to 100 percent \\n(p. 302). For other stages see Table 23.28.\\nChemotherapy is being widely used following cytoreductive surgery to improve the result in terms of survival. \\nPlatinum-based compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), either alone or in combination with taxane, prolong the \\nsurvival rate. Taxane derivatives (paclitaxel, docetaxel) are effective in cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer. \\nTreatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 3–6 cycles is desirable for most patients.\\nContd...\\nContd...\\nCh-23.indd   391 15-11-2013   17:02:46'),\n",

A desire to void is reached, not by increased \\nintravesical pressure but by stimulation of stretch \\nreceptors in the bladder wall.\\nThe sensation passes up the spinal roots S2, S3 and \\nS4 and in untrained bladder  (children), there sets \\nin motion a reflex which automatically contracts the \\ndetrusor and results in voiding.\\nBut in the trained adults, this urge can be supp-\\nressed especially if the time or place is not con-\\nvenient. Because in adults, the reflex spinal arc is \\nunder control of the hypothalamus and higher areas of \\nthe brain (anterior part of the frontal lobes). Cerebral \\ncontrol of micturition is complex but is predominantly \\ncontrolled by pontine center. Action of detrusor can \\ntherefore, be voluntarily inhibited (Fig. 24.3).\\nWhen the time or the place is convenient, the \\nhigher centers via the hypothalamus no longer inhibit \\nthe detrusor and the bladder changes from its passive \\nto active role.

A \\ncatheter is inserted in the bladder within the next \\n10 minutes to measure the remaining urine in the \\nbladder. Normally residual urine should be < 50 mL. \\nLarge amount of residual urine indicates urinary \\nretention (inadequate bladder emptying). Residual \\nvolume measurement by ultrasonography is also \\nfairly accurate.\\nUrodynamic study: If the stress incontinence is the \\nonly symptom, there may not be any need for detailed \\nurodynamic studies.

Normal saline \\nis infused inside the bladder through the filling catheter at \\nthe rate of 50–100 ml/min. Continuous recording of fluid \\nvolume infused and pressure change is done. Patient may \\nbe asked for standing, coughing or heel bouncing, for \\nprovocation. During voiding cystometry, filling catheter is \\nremoved. Total volume voided, urine flow rate and pressure \\n(Pabd, Pves and Pdet) are recorded. Urge incontinence during \\nfilling cystometry indicates detrusor instability. Ambulatory \\nurodynamic studies are thought to be more reliable.\\nIn GSI, the cystometric evaluation is normal. The \\nvalues are abnormal in detrusor instability and sensory \\nurge incontinence.\\n Abnormal cystometry: (i) Urine leaks on \\ncoughing. No rise in detrusor pressure → GSI. \\n(ii) Detrusor contractions during filling phase → \\nOveractive bladder.\\nAmbulatory monitoring  using microtip pressure \\ntransducers (twin channel) is found to increase the detection \\nof overactive bladder. This test is more physiological.\\nUrethral pressure profi  les\\nFor a continent woman urethral pressure must be \\nhigher than the bladder pressure. Urethral pressure \\nprofile test is performed with a special catheter having \\nmicrotip pressure transducers, which is slowly pulled \\ndown from the bladder (filled with 250 ml of normal \\nsaline) along the urethra to outside. The transducer \\nmeasures the intravesical and urethral pressure while \\nit is pulled down. This pressure profile is represented \\nas a curve called urethral pressure profile. Maximum \\nurethral closure pressure is obtained by subtracting \\nintravesical pressure from maximum urethral pressure. \\nUnfortunately correlation between urethral pressure \\nand severity of incontinence is poor.\\nabnormalities are: \\n\\uf0a5 Functional length of the urethra is decreased usually \\nwell below 3cm.\\n\\uf0a5 Peak urethral pressure decreases both in supine and \\nerect position.\\n\\uf0a5 During strain, there is significant lowering of the \\nurethral closure pressure compared to intravesical \\npressure. This is pathognomonic of GSI.\\nLeak-point pressure test: It gives an idea about \\nsphincteric strength.\\nMethod: Patient is asked to strain (valsala maneuver) when \\nthe bladder is filled up to a reasonable volume (200 mL) \\nto increase intravesical pressure. The minimum pressure \\n(cm H2O) at which leakage is observed is recorded as \\n‘Valsalva (abdominal) leak-point pressure’. If no leakage \\nis observed even at the highest pressure exerted (cm H2O), \\nit is recorded as “no leakage”. If reflects maximum urethral \\nclosure pressure.\\nUrethral sphincter dysfunction is common in elderly \\nwomen. Intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) and urethral \\nhypermobility often co-existent. ISD is defined when \\nmaximum urethral closure pressure is < 20 cm H2O. These \\nwomen are benefitted with some obstructive procedures (see \\np......) rather than traditional incontinence surgery. \\n Cystoscopy and urethroscopy — are not done as \\na routine but can be performed in selected cases.

Paraurethral and paravesical \\nendopelvic fascia are stitched to the periosteum at the \\nback of the symphysis pubis [Fig. 24.9A(b)].\\nComplications are: (i) hemorrhage during \\ndissection of the space (ii) urethra and bladder neck \\ninjury due to injudicious placement of sutures; \\n(iii) osteitis pubis (MMK procedure) (iv) voiding \\ndifficulty (v) detrusor instability (vi) enterocele \\nformation (vii) VVF; (viii) failure and recurrence.\\nProcedure\\nDorsolithotomy position of the patient is made and \\nurological drape is used. This helps the surgeon to operate \\nwith fingers in the vagina when required. Foley’s catheter \\n(18–20 size) is inserted. Dissection of bladder neck and \\nupper urethra is done. Suture material used is either \\npolyglycolic or ethibond. 3–4 sutures are placed on each \\nside at 0.5 cm apart. Hemostasis is checked and sutures are \\ntied. Drainage at the retropubic space is left and suprapubic \\ncatheter is inserted.\\n(c) Endoscopic bladder-neck suspension (colpo-\\nsuspension)—This procedure is simple and takes little \\ntime (Fig. 24.8B). There are various modifications \\nof this operation following original description by \\nPereyra later on by Raz and Stamey. This procedure \\nsuspends the paraurethral and paravesical tissue \\non either side of bladder-neck to the rectus sheath.  \\nBladder-neck region is dissected, through the vagina. A \\nsmall suprapubic incision is made. Sutures are passed \\nbetween vagina and anterior abdominal wall with a \\nspecial needle under cystoscopic guidance. It primarily \\ncorrects the anatomic hypermobility of the bladder-\\nneck and urethra. Long-term success rate is around \\n50 percent. It is specially suited for elderly women.\\n\\uf0be Tension-free Midurethral Tape Procedures\\n\\uf074 Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT). It was devised \\nby Petros (1993) and Ulmstem (1996).  A marlex \\nor Goretex tape is passed vaginally in a ‘U’ shape \\nmanner, under the midurethra to the either side with \\nspecially designed needles (Fig. 24.10). The needles \\nare passed along the back of the pubic bone to the skin \\nincision one on either side of the midline. Cystoscopy \\nis done at the end of the procedure. Dissection is \\nminimal and the tape is not sutured to any structure \\n(tension-free). This acts by improving the midurethral \\nsupport. TVT increases urethralcoaptation by \\nkinking the urethra during increased intra-abdominal \\npressure.  This is less invasive and operative time is \\nshort. Common complications are : injury to bladder, \\nretropubic hematoma, sling erosion and overactive \\nbladder. Success rate is about 80–90 percent at 3 years.\\n\\uf074 Transobturator Tape (TOT)—Fig. 24.9\\nIt is a minimally invasive procedure designed by \\nDelorme (2001) to support the urethra as a hammock. \\nA 2 cm incision is made in the vagina over the mid \\nurethra.

The materials used for sling are—\\n(i) organic, (autogenous)—rectus sheath (Aldridge \\nprocedure), fascia lata or (ii) inorganic—silastic, \\nmarlex, goretex. Combined approach, vaginal and \\nabdominal (retropubic space) is made. Sling is passed \\naround the bladder neck and is fixed to rectus sheath \\nunder minimal tension to act as a hammock.

Among the \\nelderly women, overactive bladder is the commonest \\ncause of urinary incontinence. Overall prevalance is \\n12–15% in women aged 40 years or more.\\neTIOlOGY : The condition is largely functional and \\npsycho-somatic in origin. The patient may be of \\nemotionally labile type or passing through a phase \\nof anxiety, stress. Sometimes, a hypertonic detrusor \\nis even stimulated by bodily movements like getting \\nup from sitting or lying position. The causative \\nfactors are:\\n\\uf074 Idiopathic—majority.    \\n\\uf074 Psychosomatic.\\n\\uf074 Following surgery for incontinence.\\n\\uf074 Detrusor hyper-reflexia (neurogenic)—Multiple \\nsclerosis, spinal injuries, early parkinsonism, \\ndiabetic neuropathy, cerebrovascular accident, etc.\\nDetrusor overactivity is basically due to acetyl-\\ncholine induced stimulation of detrusor musarinic \\nreceptors.\\nPaTHOPHYSIOlOGY : The pathophysiology is \\nobscure. There may be increased alpha-adrenergic \\nactivities causing increased detrusor contraction. \\nThe identical situation occurs in initiating an event of \\nnormal micturition—relaxation of urethral sphincter \\nmechanism followed by contraction of detrusor \\nmuscle. Therefore it is thought that inappropriate \\ndetrusor contraction results when there is passage of \\nurine into the proximal urethra due to incompetence \\nof the bladder neck. Incompetent bladder neck → \\nurine in proximal urethra → detrusor overactivity \\n→ incontinence. This occurs despite the effort of \\nthe individual to inhibit them. Other explanation \\nis change in the detrusor smooth muscle property \\n(due to atherosclerosis or neuropathy) that leads to \\ninappropriate detrusor overactivity. The involuntary \\ncontraction occurs at any bladder volumes—either \\nspontaneously or on provocation. There is preceding \\ndrop in urethral pressure.\\nSYMPTOMS : There is involuntary loss of urine \\nwithout any prior urge to urinate.

PBS \\nis more prevalent in women than in men. Interstitial \\ncystitis, is considered within the spectrum of PBS.\\nPathophysiology  is not known. The probable \\ncauses are: allergic, autoimmune, infective, toxins \\nor leaky urothelium secondary to poor glycosamino-\\nglycan layer.\\n SymPTOmS:  The clinical presentation varies \\nwidely. Symptoms include urgency, frequency, pelvic \\nand lower urinary tract pain, dyspareunia and urinary \\nincontinence.\\n DiagnOSiS: PBS is a diagnosis of exclusion. On \\ncystoscopy bladder frequently appears normal. On \\ndistension, petechial hemorrhages with oozing of blood \\nfrom the surface is often seen. The differential diagnosis \\nincludes cystitis, trigonitis, tuberculosis, overactive \\nbladder (OAB), bladder stones, or cancer, diverticula, \\nand urogenital atrophy due to estrogen deficiency.\\n TReaTmenT: As the diagnosis of PBS is difficult, \\ntreatment is directed to control the symptoms mainly.\\nUsually multiple interventions are done. Beha-\\nvioral therapy, pelvic floor physical therapy, \\nmedications including hormones and bladder \\ninstillation are the treatment options. \\n\\uf074 Diet: Alcohol, spices, citrus and caffeinated drinks \\nare avoided as they are found to increase bladder \\ninflammation and pain.\\n\\uf074 Drugs: Urinary tract analgesics like hyoscya- \\nmine, phenyl salicylate may reduce urethral \\nirritation. Pentosan Polysulphate, (100 mg tid) \\ndecreases urothelial permeability.\\n\\uf074 Surgery: Bladder instillation therapy—with \\nagents like steroids, sodium bicarbonate, \\nbotulinum toxin and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), \\nheparin has been found to be helpful. They need \\nto be repeated weekly for a minimum of 6 weeks.\\n� Hydrodistension: Cystoscopy and hydrodisten-\\nsion of bladder is used in refractory cases of PBS. \\nGlomerulations (petechial hemorrhages) may be \\nseen in the bladder mucosa after hydrodistension.\\n\\uf074 Other treatments: Tricyclic antidepressants, \\nantihistamines, transcutaneous electrical \\nnerve stimulation (TENS) antihistamines and \\nacupuncture have been tried as neuromodulation.\\nOVerFlOW INCONTINeNCe\\nThis occurs as a result of prolonged and neglected \\nretention. Its mechanism is probably the over-distension \\nof the bladder pulls open the internal sphincter. There \\nmay be compensatory detrusor hypertrophy.\\nThe causes of overflow incontinence are the same \\nas retention of urine which will be mentioned later \\nin the chapter.\\nUrOdYNaMIC FINdINGS : Uroflowmetry reveals \\nlow flow rate and significant residual urine.\\n Cystometry reveals large capacity of the bladder \\nand no rise of detrusor pressure during voiding.\\nTreaTMeNT : Surgical treatment of obstruction, if \\nany, has to be done.\\nIn cases of non-obstructive group, continuous \\ncatheter drainage is required. Intermittent clamping \\nof the catheter is to be done prior to its removal. \\nFollowing removal of the catheter, the residual \\nurine has to be measured. It should not be more than \\n100 mL, preferably 50 mL. If more than 100 mL, the \\ncontinuous drainage is reinstituted.\\nVOIdING  dISOrder\\ndeFINITION : Difficulty in emptying the bladder is \\ndue to dysfunction of effective detrusor contraction \\nand/or urethral sphincter mechanism. Anuria must be \\nexcluded. Normally for complete emptying of bladder, \\npelvic floor muscle (levator ani) and urethral sphincter \\n(intrinsic rhabdosphincter) must relax and at the same \\ntime the detrusor must contract. V oiding difficulties \\nmay lead to retention of urine either acute (inability \\nto void more than 12 hours without catheterisation) or \\nchronic (inability to empty the bladder more than 50 \\npercent of its volume).\\nreTeNTION  OF UrINe\\nCauses \\n1. Postoperative—the commonest cause of reten-\\ntion in gynecology. This may occur following any \\noperation on the vagina or perineum.\\n The factors operating are: \\n• Obstructive due to postoperative edema in the \\nneighborhood of the stitch line.\\n• Reflex spasm of bladder sphincters specially \\nfollowing anterior colporrhaphy.\\n• Reflex spasm of the levators following peri-\\nneorrhaphy.\\nCh-24.indd   409 15-11-2013   17:05:09'),\n",

The \\nparasympathetic is important for normal voiding.\\n \\uf086 Parasympathetic nervous system (acetylcholine receptor) activate detrusor contraction. Sympathetic system in bladder\\n(β receptor) causes relaxation and in the urethra (α receptor) causes contraction.\\n \\uf086 Urethral sphincters for continence are (i) intrinsic rhabdosphincter urethrae (containing slow twitch ﬁ  bers) and \\nextrinsic sphincter of levator ani (containing both slow and fast twitch ﬁ bers).\\n \\uf086 Intrinsic urethral sphincter maintains urethral closure at rest, where as extrinsic sphincter maintain urethral \\nclosure during stress (cough, sneeze).\\n \\uf086 Normally urethral closure pressure is maintained effectively. Any rise in intra-abdominal pressure transmitted \\nequally to the bladder and the proximal urethra. This mechanism  maintains the pressure gradient [see Figs. \\n24.5(a) and (b)].\\n \\uf086 Approximately one-third of the resting urethral pressure is due to rhabdosphincter effects, one-third to smooth \\nmuscle effects and one-third to submucous vascular plexus of the urethra.\\n \\uf086 The intravesical pressure is about 10 cm of water and is much lower than the urethral pressure (20–50 cm of \\nwater).\\n \\uf086 Normally ﬁ  rst sensation of urination is felt at 150–200 mL of bladder volume and functional bladder capacity \\nis 400–600 mL.\\n \\uf086 Continence is a state of balance between urethral closure pressure versus detrusor contraction pressure.\\n \\uf086 Urinary incontinence is either urethral or extraurethral in origin (see Table 24.1).\\n \\uf086 Nearly 30 percent of women suffer from some degree of urinary incontinence during their life time.\\n \\uf086 GSI is deﬁ  ned as involuntary urethral loss of urine when intravesical pressure exceeds the maximum urethral \\npressure in the absence of the detrusor activity.\\n \\uf086 Genuine stress incontinence (GSI) is due to anatomic hypermobility of bladder-neck and urethra (80%) and \\nalso due to urethral intrinsic sphincteric incompetence (20%).\\n \\uf086 GSI is often confused with urge incontinence (sensory) and detrusor instability (motor) (Tables 24.2 and 24.7). \\nDuring strain, there is signiﬁ  cant lowering of the urethral closure pressure.

Overall cure rate of this procedure is 84–90 percent. Injury to the bladder (during trocar \\ninsertion), hemorrhage in the retropubic space, tape rejection or erosion are the complications.\\n \\uf086 TOT is a simple procedure where a polypropylene macroporous tape is placed under the mid-urethra. The tape \\npasses through the obturator foramen either from outside in (TOT) or from inside-out (TVT-O). It maintains the \\nnatural suspension of the urethra.

Vesicovaginal fistula is the commonest one. \\n h The majority (80–90%) is obstetrical following ischemia due to obstructed labor (p. 418). In the developed \\ncountries, the fistula is mostly gynecological (80%).\\n h The fistula is best revealed in Sims’ position using Sims’ speculum (Sims’ triad p. 423). In tiny fistula, diagnosis \\nis made by three swab test. The test also differentiates it from ureterovaginal fistula. Investigations (p. 403) are \\nneeded to diagnose it exactly.\\n Local repair by flap splitting method between 3 months following delivery is the preferred surgery. Continuous \\nbladder drainage for 10–14 days following surgery should be a must (p. 406). Special postoperative care is \\nessential for success (see p. 423). If repair fails, local repair should be attempted after 3 months. In traumatic \\nfistula, specially gynecological, the repair should be done immediately during primary surgery. However, if \\ndetected in the postoperative period, the continuous bladder drainage is to be kept for about 10–14 days failing \\nwhich repair is to be done after 3 months. There are some favorable factors for successful repair (Table on  \\np. 424).\\n h Ureterovaginal fistula is common following difficult abdominal hysterectomy for cervical or broad ligament \\nfibroid, endometriosis, ovarian malignancy or radical hysterectomy (see p. 425). It may also occur following \\nvaginal hysterectomy or otherwise, in a case of simple hysterectomy. There are some anatomical locations \\nas well as pelvic pathologies where ureteric injury is more likely (see p. 425). Nature of ureteric  injury may \\nvary from kinking to complete transection. Three swab test differentiates it from a tiny VVF (p. 403). Further \\ninvestigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis and also to know the side and site of injury (see p. 408). \\nEnd-to-end anastomosis during surgery or ureteroneocystostomy is the preferred surgery in late cases.\\n h Rectovaginal fistula is common following incomplete healing or unrepaired recent complete perineal tear. Other \\ncause of RVF are obstetric, gynecological or congenital (p. 427).\\n h Diagnosis (p. 428) is important as regard the site and size of fistula.\\n h Definitive surgery for RVF may be as that of a repair of a CPT or by flap method or repair with prior colostomy \\n(p. 428).

While \\nincontinence of flatus is invariable, that of feces \\ndepends on the extent of damage of the external \\nanal sphincter. If the damage is slight, there is \\nincontinence of only loose stool but if the damage \\nis severe, there is incontinence of hard stool as well.\\n ● Soreness over the perianal region is due to constant \\nirritation by the stool. It is often surprising that, \\nthe condition may remain asymptomatic for many \\nyears and only discovered accidentally during \\npelvic examination. Overactivity of the levator \\nani makes the patient continent with the stool; the \\nincontinence of flatus being ignored.\\nSigns — Inspection of the perineum reveals:\\n ● There is absence of perineum. Vaginal and rectal \\nmucous membranes are found to be continuous, \\nonly separated by a bridge of fibrous tissue\\n(rectal mucosa is reddish and the vaginal one \\nis pinkish in color) (Fig. 26.2).\\n ● Visible dimple on the skin on either side of the \\nfused mucosa may be present.

Small vulval hematoma, if not \\nspreading may be left alone but if it is a big one or \\nspreading, along with resuscitative measures, the \\nhematoma is to be tackled under general anesthesia.\\nThis includes scooping of the blood clots after \\ngiving an incision, secure hemostasis and obliteration \\nof the dead space by interrupted mattress sutures.\\nIn supralevator hematoma or in cases of suspected \\ngut injuries, laparotomy is indicated and appropriate \\nmeasures taken.\\nFOREIGN BOdIES\\nVarious types of foreign bodies may be placed either \\nin the vagina or uterus and retained for a prolonged \\nperiod often unnoticed by the patient.

The entity is conﬁ  rmed by \\nelevated serum 17 hydroxyprogesterone and urinary pregnanetriol with karyotype 46, XX. Prenatal diagnosis \\ncan be made by CVS or amniocentesis using DNA probe.\\n \\uf086 Disorders of gonadal development include—gonadal dysgenesis, gonadal agenesis and mixed gonadal \\ndysgenesis.\\n–  Turner’s syndrome is the commonest variety of gonadal dysgenesis. The individual is short (< 60”), absence \\nof secondary sex characters with webbing of the neck and having ‘streak’ gonads. Karyotype is 45, XO with \\nlow serum E2 and elevated serum FSH. There may be mosaic Turner with karyotype—46, XX/45 XO. In pure \\ngonadal dysgenesis, the karyotype is either 46, XX or 46, XY. In mixed gonadal dysgenesis, the karyotype is \\nusually 45, XO or 46, XY.\\n \\uf086 About one-third of women with gonadal dysgenesis have major cardiovascular or renal abnormalities. \\nIndividuals with gonadal dysgenesis should have karyotying done to determine the presence of Y chromosome.\\n \\uf086 Male intersex (Testicular feminization) is rarely diagnosed prior to puberty. The patient is phenotypically \\nfemale with short blind vagina and gonads (testes) are in the labia or inguinal canal or intra-abdominal. Sex \\nchromatin is negative. Karyotype is 46, XY. Conﬁ  rmation is by gonadal biopsy (structures of testis). Gonadal \\nestrogen secretion induces normal pubertal feminization and breast development.\\n In Klinefelter’s syndrome, the sex chromatin is positive and the karyotype is XXY or XXXY. Serum gonadotropin \\nis elevated.\\n \\uf086 In true hermaphrodite, ovotestis is the commonest presentation. Sex chromatin is positive. Karyotype is usually \\n46, XX or 46, XY. Conﬁ  rmation is by gonadal biopsy.\\n \\uf086 A normal looking girl with primary amenorrhea, who has normal breast development but absent uterus, may \\nbe either a case of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome or androgen insensitivity syndrome (p. 445, \\nTable 27.1).\\n \\uf086 Gonadal dysgenesis and uterovaginal anomalies are the common causes of primary amenorrhea.\\n \\uf086 Management of intersex\\ny  Congenital adrenogenital syndrome should be treated energetically by hydrocortisone or dexamethasone. \\nApart from reduction clitoroplasty, the corrective surgery should be deferred till puberty (see p. 445).\\ny  Cases of gonadal dysgenesis should be treated by substitution therapy with estrogen and progestogen. In \\npresence of ‘Y’ chromosome, gonadectomy should be done to prevent malignancy.\\ny  In testicular feminization, gonadectomy is to be done after the development of secondary sex characters \\n(puberty) to be followed by estrogen supplementation therapy (see p. 446).\\ny  In true hermaphrodite, the genitalia inconsistent with sex assignment should be surgically removed or \\nmodiﬁ  ed (see p. 446).\\nCh-27.indd   448 15-11-2013   17:08:12'),\n",

This will \\nhelp the clinicians to sort out the clinico-pathological \\nentity.\\nPHYsIOLOGICAL\\nbefore Puberty\\nThe pituitary gonadotropins are not adequate enough \\nto stimulate the ovarian follicles for effective \\nsteroidogenesis → estrogen levels are not sufficient \\nenough to cause bleeding from the endometrium.\\nDuring Pregnancy\\nLarge amount of estrogens and chorionic gonadotropins \\nsecreted from the trophoblasts suppress the pituitary \\ngonadotropins → no maturation of the ovarian follicles. \\nDuring Lactation \\nHigh level of prolactin → inhibits ovarian response to \\nFSH → no follicular growth → hypoestrogenic state \\n→ no menstruation.

If the patient breastfeeds \\nher baby, the menstruation may be suspended in about \\n70 percent until the baby stops breast-feeding.\\nFollowing Menopause\\nNo more responsive follicles are available in the \\novaries for the gonadotropins to act. As a result, there \\nis cessation of estrogen production from the ovaries \\nwith elevation of pituitary gonadotropins.\\nPATHOLOGICAL\\nCRYPTOMENORRHEA\\nIn cryptomenorrhea, there is periodic shedding of \\nthe endometrium and bleeding but the menstrual \\nblood fails to come out from the genital tract due to \\nobstruction in the passage.\\nCAusEs\\n� Congenital � Acquired\\nCongenital\\n \\x9d Imperforate hymen\\n \\x9d Transverse vaginal septum \\n \\x9d Atresia of upper-third of vagina and cervix.\\nMorbid pathological changes, clinical features \\nand treatment of the congenital etiology have been \\ndescribed in the Chapter 4.\\nAcquired\\n \\x9d Stenosis of the cervix following amputation, deep \\ncauterization and conization.\\n \\x9d Secondary vaginal atresia following neglected and \\ndifficult vaginal delivery.\\nPATHOLOGY: There is only accumulation of blood \\nin the uterine cavity resulting in hematometra. In \\nneglected cases, the blood may enter the tubes whose \\nfimbrial ends get blocked resulting in distension of \\nthe tubes by blood → hematosalpinx.\\nCLINICAL  fEATuREs : The patients with history \\nof any of the etiological factors mentioned earlier, \\ncomplain of:\\n V Amenorrhea dated back from the events.\\n V Periodic pain lower abdomen.\\nPelvic examination reveals the offending lesion \\neither in the vagina or cervix.

In cases of secondary \\natresia of the vagina, reconstructive surgery is to be \\nperformed, to maintain the patency.\\nsuMMARY  Of CRYPTOMENORRHEA\\nCryptomenorrhea is a condition where the \\nmenstrual blood fails to come out from the genital \\ntract due to obstruction in the passage.\\nCauses\\nThe commonest cause is congenital due to \\nimperforate hymen. The acquired cause is rare due \\nto cervical stenosis following amputation, conization \\nor deep cauterization.\\nPathophysiology\\nIf the site of obstruction is low down in the vagina, \\nthe accumulated blood results in hematocolpos → \\nhematometra → hematosalpinx. If the obstruction \\nis at the cervix, it will produce hematometra → \\nhematosalpinx. Hematocolpos produces marked \\nelongation of the urethra → retention of urine.\\nClinical features\\nThe patient aged about 13–15 (congenital type) \\ncomplains of periodic pain lower abdomen. \\nHematocolpos is usually associated with urinary \\nproblems to the extent of retention of urine. \\nAbdominal examination reveals an uniform globular \\nmass in the hypogastrium. Vulval inspection reveals \\nthe bulging hymen. Rectal examination confirms the \\nfullness of the vagina and uterine mass.\\nManagement\\n(i) c ruciate incision of the hymen and drainage of \\nblood (see fig. 4.4).\\n(ii) Dilatation of the cervix in stenosis.\\nPRIMARY AMENORRHEA\\nDEfINITION : A young girl who has not yet \\nmenstruated by her 16 years of age is having primary \\namenorrhea rather than delayed menarche. The normal \\nupper age limit for menarche is 15 years.\\nIn view of lower mean age of menarche, currently a cut \\noff value at 14 years (in the absence of secondary sexual \\ncharacters) and 16 years (regardless of the presence of \\nsecondary sexual characters) is being considered.\\nCh-28.indd   450 15-11-2013   17:10:58'),\n",

The diagnosis and management of \\ncryptomenorrhea of congenital variety has already \\nbeen described in chapter 4. Only the true primary \\namenorrhea is dealt with here.\\nWhen to start investigation?\\nThe following guidelines may be of help:\\n (i) No period by 16 years of age in the presence of \\nnormal secondary sex characters.\\n (ii) No period by the age of 14 in the absence \\nof growth or development of secondary sex \\ncharacters.\\nHowever, the formula may not be applicable in \\nall cases. A patient may come with typical features \\nsuggestive of Turner and there is no point to defer \\nthe investigation or a patient of 14 with absence \\nof vagina should not be told to come after 2 years \\nfor investigation. Even in primary amenorrhea, the \\npossibility of pregnancy should be kept in mind, as \\npregnancy can occur even prior to menarche. The \\ninvestigation protocols can be grouped as:\\nHIsTORY, CLINICAL  ExAMINATION, \\nsPECIAL  INVEsTIGATIONs\\nHistory\\nCertain types of primary amenorrhea are of heredo-\\nfamilial in nature. Delayed menarche or androgen \\ninsensitivity syndrome often runs in family, the later \\none is often found in multiple sibs of the same family \\nand their maternal aunts.\\nMedical diseases: Genital tuberculosis or dia-\\nbetes though rare, may be responsible for primary \\namenorrhea.

The result are \\nquite satisfactory so far as the coital act is concerned. \\nThe ideal time of operation is prior to or soon after \\nmarriage.\\nCHROMOsOMAL  AbNORMALITIEs\\nIn Turner or other types of gonadal dysgenesis, short-\\nterm use of combination of estrogen and progestogen \\nis indicated at least for development of breasts (see \\np. 446). The gonads of XY gonadal dysgenesis \\nshould be removed for its increased development of \\nseminoma or dysgerminoma (see p. 446).\\nIn androgen insensitivity syndrome, the ectopic \\ngonads are to be removed after the secondary \\nsex characters are well-developed, because they \\nmay turn to malignancy. Substitution therapy after \\ngonadectomy is indicated to maintain the secondary \\nsex characters. Hormone replacement therapy with \\nconjugated equine estrogen (premarin 0.625 mg daily) \\nis adequate (see p. 446).\\nHYPOTHALAMOPITuITARY  OVARIAN AxIs \\nDEfECT\\nPatients with delayed puberty, following exclusion \\nof other causes, should be counselled and reassured. \\nOtherwise puberty may be induced using oral estrogen \\nand progestin therapy when there is severe delay. \\nGross defects in the form of adiposogenital \\ndystrophy or pituitary dwarfism are not amenable to \\nany form of therapy. In mild disorders, it is possible \\nto induce ovulation and menstruation either by \\ntreatment with gonadotropins or with GnRH analogs. \\nIndividuals with isolated gonadotropin deficiency \\n(Kallmann’s syndrome) can be treated for induction \\nof menstruation or ovulation.

Gonadotropin \\nlevels are suppressed. Hyperprolactinemia inhibits \\novarian steroidogenesis. Hyperprolactinemia causes \\nsecondary amenorrhea in about 30% of women. \\nThere is anovulation and hypogonodotropic \\nhypagonadism.\\nPITuITARY ADENOMA  (PROLACTINOMA)\\nProlactin is a protein hormone having 199 amino acids \\nwith a molecular weight of 23,000 daltons.

Little prolactin (90%) \\nhas got more biological activity. Prolactin is synthesized \\nand released primarily by the lactotrophs located in the \\nanterior pituitary gland. Extrapituitary sites of PRL \\nproduction include decidua, endometrium, lungs, \\netc. Prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary is \\nunder the inhibitory control of dopamine. Dopamine is \\nproduced in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus \\nand is released in the portal hypophyseal vessels. \\nHyperprolactinemia is commonly due to pituitary \\nadenomas (microadenoma or macroadenoma).

Androgens are formed as \\nintermediate products in the synthesis of cortisol. The \\nelevated cortisol level found in Cushing’s syndrome \\nencompasses two distinct pathologic entities.\\n − Cushing disease (ACTH dependent).\\n − Adrenal tumor (ACTH independent).\\nIn Cushing disease,  there is excess production \\nof ACTH from the anterior pituitary or from ectopic \\nsites. Basophil adenoma (microadenoma) is present in \\nabout 75 percent of cases. The increased ACTH causes \\nhyperstimulation of adrenal cortex leading to its \\nhyperplasia which in turn leads to excess production \\nof cortisol and androgens.\\nACTH independent causes (adrenal adenoma or \\ncancer) may be iatrogenic (high dose corticosteroid \\ntherapy) or adrenal tumor.\\nThe cause of adrenal mischief is cortisol secreting \\nadenoma which produces excess cortisol. The \\nandrogen production is usually less but may be \\nmarkedly elevated in presence of adrenal carcinoma.\\nSymptoms include weakness, oligomenorrhea, \\namenorrhea, acne and hirsutism. Virilism is rare. \\nSigns include — moon facies, centripetal obesity and \\nabdominal striae (Fig. 28.7).\\nThe syndrome is often associated with hypertension, \\nosteoporosis and insulin dependent diabetes.\\nThe screening test consists of dexamethasone  \\n(1 mg) ingested at 11 pm and serum cortisol obtained at  \\n8 am the following day. Level less than 5 µg/100 mL \\nessentially rules out the Cushing’s syndrome. Value \\nof 24 hour urinary free cortisol > 250 µg is diagnostic \\nof Cushing’s syndrome. Serum ACTH is elevated in \\nCushing disease but not in adrenal tumor. CT or MRI \\ncan detect adrenal tumor.\\nTHYROID DYsfuNCTION\\nBoth hypo- and hyperthyroid states may produce \\nsecondary amenorrhea and anovulation, the former \\nis common. Serum TSH is raised, while T3 and T 4 \\nvalues are lowered in hypothyroid state. In subclinical \\nhypothyroid state, while serum TSH is elevated but \\nT4 is normal. Serum prolactin may be raised even \\nbeyond 20 ng/mL  in hypothyroid state. This is due \\nto increased sensitivity of prolactin secreting cells of \\nanterior pituitary to TRH.\\nPOsTPILL  AMENORRHEA\\nIt is observed in less than 1% of the women following \\nthe use of combined oral contraceptive pills.

On the other hand \\namenorrhea and oligomenorrhea indicates ovarian, endometrial and/or HPO axis dysfunction.\\n \\uf086 The most common cause of secondary amenorrhea (pathological) is hypothalamic dysfunction.\\n \\uf086 Commonest cause of cryptomenorrhea is imperforate hymen. The symptoms include periodic lower abdominal \\npain and occasional retention of urine. The treatment is cruciate incision of the hymen and drainage of blood \\n(see p. 42).\\n \\uf086 Common causes of primary amenorrhea are gonadol failure, abnormal chromosomal pattern, development \\ndefect of  genital tract and disturbed function of the hypothalamopituitaryovarian axis.\\n As such detailed history, clinical examination and speciﬁ  c investigations most often clinch the diagnosis of \\nprimary amenorrhea (see Tables 28.1 and 28.2 and Scheme-A).\\n \\uf086 Women with primary amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism should have CT scan to rule out \\nCNS lesion. Karyotyping is not needed.\\n The scope of therapeutic success in the management of primary amenorrhea is very limited.\\n XY gonads should be removed for its increased risk of malignancy. Substitution estrogen therapy should be \\nprescribed for the development and maintenance of secondary sex characters.\\n \\uf086 Amenorrheic patients may belong to any of the four groups : (i) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (p. 452); \\n(ii) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (p. 451); (iii) hyperprolactinemia (p. 464) or (iv) normogonadotropic \\nanovulation (p. 459).\\n \\uf086 Hypothalamic hypogonadism is associated with reduced FSH and LH. There is no follicular growth and \\nestradiol production (p. 451).\\n \\uf086 Common causes of secondary amenorrhea are hypothalamic dysfunction, PCOS, stress, premature ovarian \\nfailure and hypothyroid state (see Table 28.3).

Weight reduction is an important step. \\nCorrection of hyperandrogenemia (p. 470), hyperprolactinemia (p. 471), hyperinsulinemia and elevated LH \\nlevels (see p. 470) are the others. Metformin ameliorates the biochemical abnormalities. Ovulation induction \\nhas higher success when clomiphene is combined with metformin (insulin sensitizing agent).

Majority of women with \\nhyperprolactinemia, amenorrhea and galactorrhea will have prolactinoma. Most microadenomas (< 1 cm in \\ndiameter) do not enlarge with time. Bromocriptine shrinks 80–90 percent of macroadenomas. Most common \\nside effects of bromocriptine therapy are nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Cabergoline is more \\neffective and is better tolerated.\\n \\uf086 MRI is the best diagnostic modality for pituitary adenomas or empty sella syndrome.\\n \\uf086 Hyperprolactinemia is present in 15 percent of all anovulatory women. Nearly 60 percent of all women with \\ngalactorrhea have hyperprolactinemia. Nearly 90 percent of women with galactorrhea and amenorrhea have \\nhyperprolactinemia. About 5 percent of women with hyperprolactinemia have hypothyroidism (p. 445).\\nBromocriptine treatment returns prolactin level to normal in 90 percent, induces ovulation in 80 percent and \\ncures galactorrhea in 60 percent of cases (p. 471).\\nCombined oral contraceptives do not stimulate the growth of prolactin secreting microadenomas.\\n \\uf086 Pregnancy induced by bromocriptine is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation or \\nmultiple pregnancy (p. 471).\\n \\uf086 Surgical treatment of prolactinomas is done when there is failure of medical treatment but long-term recurrence \\nrate is about 20 percent (p. 471). \\n \\uf086 In masculinizing ovarian tumor, serum testosterone is elevated to > 2 ng/mL while DHEA–S is normal. Elevated \\nDHEA–S reﬂ  ects adrenal androgen excess (p. 544). Serum levels of DHEA–S correlate well with daily urinary \\n17 KS excretion.\\n \\uf086 In Sheehan’s syndrome, there is failing lactation, loss of pubic and axillary hair, secondary amenorrhea and \\natrophy of the breasts. Hormones affected in order of frequency are GH, FSH, LH, TSH and ACTH. \\nIn Cushing disease, there is excess production of ACTH leading to excess secretion of cortisol and androgen \\nproduction. The symptoms of Cushing syndrome include weakness, amenorrhea, acne and hirsutism; signs \\ninclude moon facies, centripetal obesity and abdominal striae. \\nThe diagnosis of a case of secondary amenorrhea is difﬁ  cult to make out from the clinical examination (scheme \\n– B). Pregnancy must be excluded prior hand. Even though, there is no galactorrhea, serum prolactin, TSH \\nestimation and X-ray sella turcica are mandatory as the ﬁ  rst step of investigation. When no abnormality is \\ndetected and the patient is not anxious about amenorrhea and or fertility, no treatment is required (p. 469).\\nIn primary amenorrhea, more investigations are often done to ﬁ  nd out the cause with minimal effect. In secondary \\namenorrhea, with comparative fewer investigations, the result is satisfactory (p. 472).\\nCh-28.indd   474 15-11-2013   17:11:07'),\n",

The \\ndistance between the tip of the middle finger placed \\nin the posterior fornix and the point over the finger \\nbelow the symphysis pubis gives the approximate \\ndiameter of the diaphragm. Diaphragm should \\ncompletely cover the cervix. As it cannot effectively \\nprevent ascent of the sperms alongside the margin \\nof the device, additional chemical spermicidal agent \\nshould be placed on the superior surface of the \\ndevice during insertion, so that it remains in contact \\nwith the cervix.

These agents \\nmostly cause sperm immobilization. The cream or \\njelly is introduced high in the vagina with the help \\nof the applicator soon before coitus. Foam tablets \\n(1–2) are to be introduced high in the vagina at least \\n5 minutes prior to intercourse. In isolation, it is not \\neffective (18–29 HWY), but enhances the efficacy of \\ncondom or diaphragm when used along with it. There \\nmay be occasional local allergic manifestations either \\nin the vagina or vulva.\\nVaginal contraceptive sponge (Today): It is made of \\npolyurethane impregnated with 1 g of nonoxynol-9 \\nas a spermicide. Nonoxynol-9 acts as a surfactant \\nwhich either immobilizes or kills sperm. It releases \\nspermicide during coitus, absorbs ejaculate and \\nblocks the entrance to the cervical canal. The \\nsponge should not be removed for 6 hours after \\nintercourse. Its failure rate (HWY) is about — \\nParous women: 32-20, Nulliparous 16-9. Currently \\nit is observed that nonoxynol–9 is not effective in \\npreventing cervical gonorrhea, chlamydia or HIV \\ninfection. Moreover, it produces lesions in the \\ngenital tract when used frequently. Those lesions are \\nassociated with increased risk of HIV transmission.\\nFertility Awareness Method (Table 29.5): Fertility \\nAwareness Method requires partner’s cooperation. \\nThe woman should know the fertile time of her \\nmenstrual cycle. \\nRhythm Method: This is the only method approved by \\nthe Roman Catholic Church. The method is based on \\nidentification of the fertile period of a cycle and to \\nabstain from sexual intercourse during that period. \\nThis requires partner’s cooperation. The methods to \\ndetermine the approximate time of ovulation and the \\nfertile period include — (a) recording of previous \\nmenstrual cycles (calendar rhythm) (b) noting the \\nbasal body temperature chart (temperature rhythm) \\nand (c) noting excessive mucoid vaginal discharge \\n(mucus rhythm). The users of the calendar method \\nobtain the period of abstinence from calculations based \\non the previous twelve menstrual cycle records. The \\nfirst unsafe day is obtained by subtracting 20 days \\nfrom the length of the shortest cycle and last unsafe \\nday by deducting 10 days from the longest cycle. Users \\nof temperature rhythm require abstinence until the \\nthird day of the rise of temperature. Users of mucus \\nrhythm require abstinence on all days of noticeable \\nmucus and for 3 days thereafter.\\nCoitus Interruptus (withdrawal) (Table 29.6):  It \\nis the oldest and probably the most widely accepted \\ncontraceptive method used by man. It necessitates \\nwithdrawal of penis shortly before ejaculation. \\nAdvantages disadvantages\\n• no appliance is required • r equires sufficient self-control by the man\\n• no cost • t he woman may develop anxiety neurosis, vaginismus \\nor pelvic congestion\\n• chance of pregnancy is more :\\n(a) p recoital secretion may contain sperm\\n(b) Accidental chance of sperm deposition into the vagina Failure rate  — 20 (HWY)\\ntAblE 29.6  c oItuS IntErruPtuS\\ntAblE 29.5  FErtIlIty A wArEnESS MEtHodS (rHytHM MEtHod)\\n failure rate  — 20–30 (hWy)\\nAdvantages disadvantages\\n•\\t no cost •\\t difficult to calculate the safe period reliably\\n•\\t Lack of side effects •\\t needs several months training to use these methods\\n•\\t compulsory abstinence from sexual act during certain periods\\n•\\t not applicable during lactational amenorrhea or when the periods \\nare irregularFailure rate— 20-30 (HWY)'),\n",

This is more effective in \\nwomen who are amenorrheic than those who are \\nmenstruating. The risk of pregnancy to a woman who \\nis fully breastfeeding and amenorrheic is less than 2 \\npercent in the first 6 months. Otherwise, the failure \\nrate is high (1–10%). Thus during breastfeeding, \\nadditional contraceptive support should be given by \\ncondom, IUCD or injectable steroids where available \\nto provide complete contraception.\\nWhen the women is full breastfeeding, a contraceptive \\nmethod should be used in the 3rd postpartum month \\nand with partial or no breastfeeding, she should use \\nit in the 3rd postpartum week.\\nFertility awareness based methods are: (1) Natural \\ncontraception (Rhythm method, Coitus interruptus \\nand Lactational amenorrhea method) (2) Barrier \\nmethod (Condoms, diaphragm and spermicides).\\nIntrAutErInE  contrAcEPtIvE  \\ndEvIcES (Iucds) \\nThe intrauterine device have been used throughout the \\nworld. During the last couple of decades, however, \\nthere has been a significant improvement in its design \\nand content. The idea is to obtain maximum efficacy \\nwithout increasing the adverse effects. The device is \\nclassified as open, when it has got no circumscribed \\naperture of more than 5 mm so that a loop of intestine \\nor omentum cannot enter and become strangulated if, \\naccidentally, the device perforates through the uterus \\ninto the peritoneal cavity. Lippes loop, Cu T, Cu 7, \\nMultiload and Progestasert are examples of open \\ndevices. If closed devices, like Grafenberg ring and \\nBirnberg bow, accidentally enter the abdominal cavity, \\nthey have the potential of causing strangulation of the \\ngut; and hence are obsolete. The device may be non-\\nmedicated as Lippes loop or medicated (bioactive) \\nby incorporating a metal copper, in devices like \\nCu T-200, Cu T-380A, Multiload-250, Multiload-375 \\n(Fig. 29.2).\\nHormone containing IUD either releasing \\nprogesterone (progestasert) or levonorgestrel (LNG-\\nIUS) has also been introduced.

Stem of the T-shaped device is \\nmade of a polyethylene frame. It has a polyethylene \\nmonofilament tied at the end of the vertical stem. \\nThese two threads are used for detection and removal. \\nIn spite of the copper being radiopaque, additional \\nbarium sulfate is incorporated in the device. The \\ndevice contains 124 mg of copper. The copper is \\nlost at the rate of about 50 µg per 24 hours during a \\nperiod of one year. It is supplied inside a sterilized \\nsealed packet. The device is to be removed after 4 \\nyears. Cu T 200 carries 200 sq mm surface area of \\nwire containing 120 mg of copper and is removed \\nafter 3 years. Apart from the use of Cu T as a \\ncontraceptive, it is used following synaecolysis:\\nCu T 380A  — Cu T 380A carries total 380 mm 2 \\nsurface area of copper wire wound around the stem \\n(314 mm2) and each copper sleeve on the horizontal \\narms (33 mm2). The frame contains barium sulfate and \\nis radiopaque. Replacement is every 10 years.\\nMultiload Cu 250 — The device emits 60–100 µg of \\ncopper per day during a period of one year. The device \\nis to be replaced every 3 years.\\nMultiload–375 — The device is available in a \\nsterilized sealed packet with an applicator. There is \\nno introducer and no plunger. It has 375 mm2 surface \\narea of copper wire wound around its vertical stem. \\nReplacement is every 5 years (Fig. 29.2).\\nLevonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) \\n(Fig. 29.2D) — This is a T-shaped device, with \\npolydimethylsiloxane membrane around the stem \\nwhich acts as a steroid reservoir. Total amount of \\nlevonorgestrel is 52 mg and is released at the rate 20 \\nµg/day. This device is to be replaced every 7 years. \\nIts efficacy is comparable to sterilization. It has many \\nnon-contraceptive benefits also (p. 484).\\nProgestasert — It is a progesterone (38 mg) containing IUD. \\nProgestasert is no longer manufactured. \\nLippes Loop — It is a non-medicated open intrauterine \\ndevice. It is no longer used in India.\\nMode of action: Mechanism of antifertility effect of \\nall the IUDs is not yet clear. They act predominantly \\nin the uterine cavity and do not inhibit ovulation. \\nProbable factors are: \\n x Biochemical and histological changes in the \\nendometrium — There is a nonspecific inflammatory \\nreaction along with biochemical changes in the \\nendometrium which have got gametotoxic and \\nspermicidal property. Lysosomal disintegration from \\nthe macrophages attached to the device liberates \\nprostaglandins, which are toxic to spermatozoa. \\nMacrophages cause phagocytosis of spermatozoa.\\n x There may be increased tubal motility which \\nprevent fertilization of the ovum. \\n x Endometrial inflammatory response decreases \\nsperm transport and impedes the ability of sperm \\nto fertilize the ovum.\\n x Copper devices — Ionized copper has got an \\nadditional local antifertility effect by preventing \\nblastocyst implantation through enzymatic \\ninterference. Copper initiates the release of \\ncytokines which are cytotoxic. Serum copper \\nlevel is not increased. It seems that the progressive \\ncalcium deposition in the device prevents copper \\ndiffusion, if kept for longer period.\\n x Levonorgestrel-IUS (Mirena)— It induces \\nstrong and uniform suppression of endometrium. \\nCervical mucus becomes very scantly. Anovulation \\nand insufficient luteal phase activity has also \\nbeen mentioned. Serum progesterone level is not \\nincreased.\\n Contraindications for Insertion of IUCD:  \\n(1) Presence o\\\\f  pelvic infection current or within \\n3 months; (2) Undiagnosed genital tract bleeding;  \\n(3) Suspected pregnancy; (4) Distortion of the shape \\nof the uterine cavity as in fibroid or congenital \\nuterine-malformation; (5) Severe dysmenorrhea; \\n(6) Past history of ectopic pregnancy; (7) Within \\n6 weeks following cesarean section; (8) STIs — \\nCurrent or within 3 months; (9) Trophoblastic disease; \\n(10) Significant immunosuppression.

(3) The insertion is done \\nin the outpatient department, taking aseptic precautions \\nwithout sedation or anesthesia. To reduce cramping pain \\nIbuprofen (NSAID) may be given (200–400 mg) 30 \\nminutes before insertion. (4) Placement of the device \\ninside the inserter — The device is taken out from the \\nsealed packet. The thread, the vertical stem and then the \\nhorizontal stem folded to the vertical stem are introduced \\nthrough the distal end of the inserter. The device is now \\nready for introduction. “ No touch”  insertion method is \\npreferred (see below).\\n(B) Actual steps \\n(1) The patient empties her bladder and is placed in \\nlithotomy position. Uterine size and position are ascertained \\nby pelvic examination. (2) Posterior vaginal speculum \\nis introduced and the vagina and cervix are cleansed by \\nantiseptic lotion. (3) The anterior lip of the cervix is grasped \\nby Allis forceps. A sound is passed through the cervical canal \\nto note the position of the uterus and the length of the uterine \\ncavity. The appropriate length of the inserter is adjusted \\ndepending on the length of the uterine cavity. (4) The inserter \\nwith the device placed inside is then introduced through the \\ncervical canal right up to the fundus and after positioning it \\nby the guard, the inserter is withdrawn keeping the plunger \\nin position. Thus,  the device is not pushed out of the \\ntube but held in place by the plunger while the inserter \\nis withdrawn (withdrawal technique in Figure 29.3). \\n(5) The excess of the nylon thread beyond 2–3 cm from the \\nexternal os is cut.

The patient should be \\nadvised to feel the thread periodically by the finger. \\nThe patient is checked after 1 month and then annually.\\ncomplications\\nImmediate: x Cramp like pain — It is transient but \\nat times, severe and usually lasts for 1/2 to 1 hour. It is \\nrelieved by analgesic or antispasmodic drugs.\\nx Syncopal attack—Pain and syncopal attack \\nare more often found in nulliparous or when the \\ndevice is large enough to distend the uterine cavity. \\nx Partial or complete perforation — It is due to \\nfaulty technique of insertion but liable to be met \\nwith in lactational period when the uterus remains \\nsmall and soft.\\nRemote: \\n x Pain — The pain is more or less proportionate to \\nthe degree of myometrial distension. A proper size \\nof the device may minimize the pain. \\n x Abnormal menstrual bleeding — The excessive \\nbleeding involves increased menstrual blood \\nloss, prolongation of duration of period and \\nintermenstrual bleeding. The patient may become \\nanemic and is of concern in one who is already \\nanemic. Iron supplement is advocated. Tranexamic \\nacid may be given for short-term relief. Menstrual \\nloss is much less with the use of third generation \\nIUDs (see p. 484).\\n x Pelvic infection (PID) — The risk of developing \\nPID is 2–10 times greater amongst IUD users. The \\nrisk is more in the first 3 weeks. Infection with \\nchlamydia and rarely with actinomyces are seen. \\nNewer IUDs reduce the risk (see p. 484).\\n  Pain,  abnormal uterine bleeding and \\nPID are the principal factors related to its \\ndiscontinuation (10–15%).\\n x Spontaneous expulsion—Usually occurs within a \\nfew months following insertion, more commonly \\nduring the period, at times unnoticed by the \\npatient. Failure to palpate the thread which could \\nbe felt before, is an urgent ground to report to the \\nphysician. The expulsion rate is about 5 percent. \\nThe rate is, however, more following postabortal \\nor puerperal insertions. The expulsion rate is \\nmarkedly reduced in the successive years. Another \\ndevice of appropriate size may be reintroduced \\nand this is likely to be retained.

It should not \\nbe used in newly married women or when any pelvic \\npathology is present. The device can be introduced in \\nthe interval period or following abortion or following \\nchildbirth. The introduction is an outdoor procedure and can \\nbe done even by a trained paramedical personnel without \\nanesthesia. The technique employed is either “push-out” \\nin Lippes loop or “withdrawal” in Cu T. The immediate \\ncomplications include cramp-like pains or even syncopal \\nattacks.

It is also helpful to counteract \\nthe adverse effects of estrogen on the endometrium \\n(endometrial hyperplasia and heavy withdrawal \\nbleeding). It is also responsible for changes in the \\ncervical mucus (vide supra).\\nSelection of the patient: History and general \\nexamination should be thorough, taking special \\ncare to screen cases for contraindications (headache, \\nmigraine). Examination of the breasts for any \\nnodules, weight and blood pressure are to be noted. \\nPelvic examination to exclude cervical pathology, \\nis mandatory. Pregnancy must be excluded. Cervical \\ncytology to exclude abnormal cells, is to be done. \\nThus, any woman of reproductive age group without \\nany systemic disease and contraindications listed, is a \\nsuitable candidate for combined pill therapy. Growth \\nand development of the pubertal and sexually active \\ngirls are not affected by the use of “pill”.\\nHow to prescribe a pill:  INSTRUCTION: New \\nusers should normally start their pill packet on day \\none of their cycle. One tablet is to be taken daily \\npreferably at bed time for consecutive 21 days. It is \\ncontinued for 21 days and then have a 7 days break, \\nwith this routine there is contraceptive protection \\nfrom the first pill. Next pack should be started on the \\neighth day, irrespective of bleeding (same day of the \\nweek, the pill finished). Thus, a simple regime of  \\n“3 weeks on and 1 week off ” is to be followed. \\nPacking of 28 tablets, there should be no break \\nbetween packs. Seven of the pills are dummies and \\ncontain either iron or vitamin preparations. However, \\na woman can start the pill up to day 5 of the bleeding. \\nIn that case she is advised to use a condom for the \\nnext 7 days. The pill should be started on the day after \\nabortion. Following childbirth in non-lactating woman, \\nit is started after 3 weeks and in lactating woman it is \\nto be withheld for 6 months (see later in the chapter).\\nFollow-uP : The patient should be examined after \\n3 months, then after 6 months and then yearly. The \\npatient above the age 35 should be checked more \\nfrequently. At each visit, any adverse symptoms are \\nto be noted. Examination of the breasts, weight and \\nblood pressure recording and pelvic examination \\nincluding cervical cytology, are to be done and \\ncompared with the previous records.\\nMISSEd PIllS : Normally there is return of pituitary \\nand ovarian follicular activity during the pill-free \\ninterval (PFI) of 7 days. Breakthrough ovulation \\nmay occur in about 20 percent cases during the time. \\nLengthening of PFI due to omissions, malabsorption, \\nor vomiting either at the start or at the end of a packet, \\nincreases the risk of breakthrough ovulation and \\ntherefore pregnancy.\\nManagement: When a woman forgets to take one \\npill (late up to 24 hours), she should take the missed \\npill at once and continue the rest as schedule. There \\nis nothing to worry. \\nWhen she misses two pills in the first week (days \\n1–7), she should take 2 pills on each of the next  \\n2 days and then continue the rest as schedule.

Low dose oral contraceptives \\nimproves acne as levonorgestrel preparations are \\nless androgenic.\\n y Menstrual abnormalities—(a) Breakthrough \\nbleeding (BTB) is commonly due to subthreshold \\nblood level of hormones.

Exogenous estrogen (conjugated \\nestrogen 1.25 mg or estradiol 2 mg) given daily \\nfor 7 days can control the bleeding. Doubling up \\nthe active pills for 2–3 days, or until bleeding \\nstops, is helpful. A pill containing higher dose \\nof estrogen, with different progestin could be \\nhelpful. BTB is not associated with any increased \\nfailure rate. (b) Hypomenorrhea (PGN) — It is \\nof little significance although disturbing to the \\npatient. It is due to the local endometrial changes. \\n(c) Menorrhagia (OGN) — It is usually pre-\\nexisting and use of compounds with progestin \\npreponderance is helpful. (d) Amenorrhea (OGN \\nor PGN) — Post pill amenorrhea of more than \\n6 months duration occurs in less than 1 percent \\ncases. The association is casual not causal. It \\nis usually more in women with pre-existing \\nfunctional menstrual disorders. Spontaneous \\nresumption of menstruation occurs in majority of \\ncases. A refractory case (> 12 months) should be \\ninvestigated as a case of secondary amenorrhea.\\n y Libido: Libido may be diminished (PGN)  \\nprobably due to dryness of the vagina. More often, \\nit may either remain static or at times, may even \\nincrease due to loss of fear of pregnancy.\\n y Leucorrhea: It may be due to excessive cervical \\nmucus secretion (OGN) or due to increased \\npreponderance of monilial infection (OGN + PGN).\\nThe major complications are: \\n y Depression: Low dose estrogen preparations are \\nnot associated with depression.\\n y Hypertension (OGN): Current low dose COC S \\nrarely cause significant hypertension. Pre-existing \\nhypertension is likely to be aggravated. Changes \\nare seen only in systolic but not in diastolic blood \\npressure. The effect on blood pressure is thought \\nto involve the renin-angiotensin system. There is \\nmarked increase in plasma angiotensinogen.

Low \\ndose COCs have no effect on insulin, HbA 1C, and fasting \\nglucose levels. y Protein (OGN): Estrogen has got some \\nstimulatory effect on the hepatic secretion of many proteins. \\nThe level of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is \\nincreased. y Lipid (OGN): Plasma lipids and lipoproteins \\nare increased. Total cholesterol and triglycerides are \\nincreased. Low dose estrogen increases HDL cholesterol \\nand decreases LDL cholesterol thereby exerts its protective \\neffect against atherosclerosis. Progestins however decrease \\nHDL cholesterol and increase LDL cholesterol thereby \\npromote heart disease. Preparations with more selective, \\nlipid friendly and third generation progestins namely \\ndesogestrel, gestodene or norgestimate, HDL level is \\nsomewhat elevated. However, most changes are within the \\nnormal range and not clinically relevant.\\n y Vitamins and minerals: Vitamin B 6, B12, folic acid, \\ncalcium, manganese, zinc and ascorbic acid levels are \\ndecreased while vitamins A and K levels are increased.\\neFFeCTS on or GAnS:  x Hypothalamopituitary \\naxis: Both FSH and LH levels remain low as found in \\nearly proliferative phase and remain throughout the cycle at \\nsuch static low level. x Ovary: Ovarian function remains \\nquiescent with occasional evidence of breakthrough \\novulation. There is evidence of fibrosis, progressive wastage \\nof unripe ova with advancing age without evidence of \\ncorpus luteum. The endogenous hormones remain static at \\na low level. x  Endometrium (PGN) — Stromal edema, \\ndecidual reaction and glandular exhaustion out of depletion \\nof glycogen are more or less constant findings.\\n x Cervix (PGN + OGN)—Increased glandular \\nhyperplasia and downgrowth of the endocervical \\nepithelium beyond the squamocolumnar junction gives \\nthe appearance of an ectopy. Relative risk of cervical \\ncancer with COC use is 1.1. It may be due to the \\npersistent exposure of the pill users to HPV infection \\nor due to their more sexual activity.\\n x Uterus (OGN)—Uterus may be slightly enlarged. \\nLow dose COCs do not usually increase the size of a \\npre-existing fibroid. COCs can reduce the amount of \\nmenstrual bleeding.\\n x Vagina (PGN)—Cytohormonal study reflects the \\npicture of early luteal phase. x Other organs:  \\n(i) Liver — The liver functions are depressed.  \\n(ii) Gastrointestinal tract — There is increased \\nincidence of mesenteric vein thrombosis. (iii) Urinary \\n— There is increased incidence of urinary tract infection \\nbut is probably related to increase in sexual activity.\\neFFeCTS on reProDUCTIon: x Ovulation returns \\nwithin 3 months of withdrawal of the drug in 90 percent \\ncases. x Risk to fetus: When COC is taken during early \\npregnancy inadvertently there is no greater risk of significant \\ncongenital anomaly. Risk of congenital abnormality in general \\nis 2–3 percent. x  Lactation (OGN + PGN): Lactation is \\nprobably affected by a reduction in the milk production and \\nalso by alteration of the quality of the milk (reduction of \\nprotein and fat content). Moreover, significant amount of \\nthe steroids are ingested by the infant, the effects are as yet \\nunknown. Mini-pill is a better alternative for the breastfeeders.\\nTrIPHASIC ForMUlATIonS oF CoMBIneD orAl \\nPIllS: In these preparations, the hormonal doses of each \\ncompound vary over the course of the cycle. Minimum doses \\nare provided for contraceptive effect in the early part of the \\ncycle and slightly higher doses later in the cycle to prevent \\nbreakthrough bleeding. It is an attempt to minimize \\nundesirable side effects on lipid metabolism.  This is due \\nto low total amount of steroids and the balanced estrogen-\\nprogestogen relationship.\\nTriquilar tablets (Shering-AG) — First 6 tablets contain \\n0.05 mg levonorgestrel and 30 mg of ethinyl estradiol; \\nnext 5 tablets contain 0.075 mg levonorgestrel and  '),\n",

It has to be taken daily from the first day \\nof the cycle.\\nMechanism of action: It works mainly by making \\ncervical mucus thick and viscous, thereby prevents \\nsperm penetration. Endometrium becomes atrophic, \\nso blastocyst implantation is also hindered. In about 2 \\npercent of cases ovulation is inhibited and 50 percent \\nwomen ovulate normally.\\nHow to prescribe mini pill: The first pill has to be \\ntaken on the first day of the cycle and then continuously. \\nIt has to be taken regularly and at the same time of \\nthe day. There must be no break between the packs. \\nDelay in intake for more than 3 hours, the woman \\nshould have missed pill immediately and the next one \\nas schedule. Extra precaution has to be taken for next \\n2 days (see above). \\nAdvantages: (1) Side effects attributed to estrogen \\nin the combined pill are totally eliminated (2) No \\nadverse effect on lactation and hence can be suitably \\nprescribed in lactating women and as such it is often \\ncalled “Lactation Pill” (3) Easy to take as there is \\nno “On and Off” regime (4) It may be prescribed \\nin patient having (medical disorders) hypertension, \\nfibroid, diabetes, epilepsy, smoking and history of \\nthromboembolism (5) Reduces the risk of PID and \\nendometrial cancer.\\nDisadvantages: (1) There may be acne, mastalgia, \\nheadache, breakthrough bleeding, or at times \\namenorrhea in about 20–30 percent cases (2) All the \\nside effects, attributed to progestins may be evident \\n(3) Simple cysts of the ovary may be seen, but they \\ndo not require any surgery (4) Failure rate is about \\n0.5–2 per 100 women years of use. Failure is more \\nin young compared to women over 40. Women using \\ndrugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes to alter \\na metabolism (mentioned above) should avoid this \\nmethod of contraception. \\nContraindications: (i) Pregnancy (ii) unexplained \\nvaginal bleeding (iii) recent breast cancer (iv) arterial \\ndisease. (v) thromboembolic disease. \\nInJEctAblE ProgEStInS\\nThe preparations commonly used are depomedroxy \\nprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone \\nenanthate (NET-EN).

It is a \\nlong-term (up to 3 years) reversible contraception. \\nIt consists of a single closed capsule (made of \\npolydimethyl siloxane 40 mm × 2 mm) and contains \\n68 mg of etonorgestrel (ENG). It releases the hormone \\nabout 60 mcg, gradually reduced to 30 mcg per day \\nover 3 years. Implanon does not cause decrease in \\nbone mineral density (Fig. 29.9).\\nMechanism of action:  It inhibits ovulation in 90 \\npercent of the cycles for the first year. It has got its \\nsupplementary effect on endometrium (atrophy) and \\ncervical mucus (thick) as well.\\nInsertion: The capsule is inserted subdermally, in \\nthe inner aspect of the nondominant arm, 6–8 cm \\nabove the elbow fold. It is inserted between biceps \\nand triceps muscles. Preloaded sterile applicator is \\navailable. No incision is required. Removal is done \\nby making a 2 mm incision at the tip of the implant \\nand pushing the rod until it pops out. It is done under \\nlocal anesthetic. It is ideally inserted within D 5 of \\na menstrual cycle, immediately after abortion and 3 \\nweeks after postpartum.\\nremoval: Implanon should be removed within 3 \\nyears of insertion. Loss of contraceptive action is \\nimmediate.\\nAdvantages are the same as with DMPA. Others are \\n(i) Highly effective for long-term use and rapidly \\nreversible. (ii) Suited for women who have completed \\ntheir family but do not desire permanent sterilization. \\nEfficacy of implanon is extremely high with Pearl \\nindices of 0.01.

Currently, occlusion of the tubes with rings \\nor clips or electrocoagulation using a laparoscope \\nis gaining popularity. Hysterectomy during the \\nchildbearing period has got an incidental sterilization \\neffect but should not be done for sterilization purpose.\\ntubectomy (Figs 29.12 and 29.14): It is an \\noperation where resection of a segment of both \\nthe fallopian tubes is done to achieve permanent \\nsterilization. The approach may be: \\n(1) Abdominal (2) Vaginal\\n(1) Abdominal:\\n(A)  Conventional (B)  Minilaparotomy\\nConventional (Laparotomy)—Steps:\\n x Anesthesia: The operation can be done under general \\nor spinal or local anesthesia. In mass camp,  local \\nanesthesia is preferable. In case of local anesthesia, \\npremedication with Inj. Morphine 15 mg or Inj. \\nPethidine 100 mg with Phenergan 50 mg IM is to be \\nadministered at least 30–45 min prior to surgery. The \\nincisional area is infiltrated with 1 percent lignocaine.\\n x Incision: In puerperal cases, where the uterus is felt \\nper abdomen, the incision is made two fingers breadth \\n(1”) below the fundal height and in interval cases, the \\nincision is made 2 fingers breadth above the symphysis \\npubis. The incision may be either midline or paramedian \\nor transverse. The abdomen is opened by the usual \\nprocedure.\\n x Delivery of the tube: The index finger is introduced \\nthrough the incision. The finger is passed across the \\nposterior surface of the uterus and then to the posterior \\nleaf of the broad ligament from where the tube is \\nhooked out. The tube is identified by the fimbrial end \\nand mesosalpinx containing utero-ovarian anastomotic \\nvessels.\\n x Techniques — (Fig. 29.12): (a) Pomeroy’s: A loop is \\nmade by holding the tube by an Allis forceps in such a \\nway that the major part of the loop consists mainly of \\nisthmus and part of the ampullary part of the tube (at \\nthe junction of proximal and middle third). Through an \\navascular area in the mesosalpinx, a needle threaded \\nwith No. ‘0’ chromic catgut is passed and both the limbs \\nof the loop are firmly tied together.

The failure rate is 0.1–0.5 \\npercent. The cut ends become independently sealed off and \\nretract widely from each other (Fig. 29.12C).\\n(b) Uchida technique—A saline solution is injected \\nsubserosally in the mid portion of the tube to create a bleb. \\nThe serous coat is incised along the antimesenteric border \\nto expose the muscular tube. The tube is ligated with No. 0 \\nchromic catgut on either side and about 3–5 cm of the tube \\nis resected off. The ligated proximal stump is allowed to \\nretract beneath the serous coat. The serous coat is closed \\nwith a fine suture in such a way that the proximal stump is \\nburied but the distal stump is open to the peritoneal cavity. \\nNo failure in this method has been observed so far.\\n(c) Irving method — The tube is ligated on either side and \\nmid portion of the tube (between the ties) is excised. The \\nfree medial end of the tube is then turned back and buried \\ninto the posterior uterine wall creating a myometrial tunnel \\n(Fig. 29.12D).\\n(d) Madlener technique  (Fig. 29.12E)—It is the easiest \\nmethod. The loop of the tube is crushed with an artery \\nforceps. The crushed area is tied with black silk. The loop \\nis not excised. The failure rate is very high to the extent of \\n7 percent and hence, it is abandoned in preference to the \\nPomeroy’s technique.\\n(e) Kroener method of fimbriectomy is not a common \\nprocedure (Fig. 29.12F).\\nThe abdomen is closed in layers.

This helps manipulation of the tube in \\nbringing it close to the incisional area, when it is seized by \\nartery forceps. (5) The appropriate technique of tubectomy \\nis performed on one side and then repeated on the other \\nside. (6) The peritoneum is closed by purse string suture.\\nOnce conversant with the technique, it can be performed \\nwith satisfaction to the patient.

Alkylating agents:  These drugs transfer their \\nalkyl radical to nucleic acids. They prevent cell \\ndivision by cross-linking the DNA strands. \\nThey produce single and double stranded DNA \\nbreak. Cyclophosphamide inhibits DNA synthesis \\nin addition. These are cell cycle non-specific \\nagents (CCNS). These are most suitable for use \\nin bulky slow growing tumors. These are often \\ncalled radiomimetic drugs as they share some \\neffects of radiation.\\n Examples:\\n Cyclophosphamide (endoxan), Ifosfamide, \\nMelphalan, Thiotepa.\\n Platinum agents: Cisplatin, carboplatin, \\noxaliplatin. \\nB. Antimetabolites act by inhibiting essential \\nmetabolic processes that are required for synthesis \\nof purines, pyrimidines and nucleic acids.\\nExamples: \\n x Methotrexate—Folic acid antagonist, prevents \\nreduction of folic acid to folinic acid by \\ninhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.\\n x 5-Fluorouracil—Pyrimidine analogue, blocks \\nthymidine synthesis and prevents DNA \\nreplication.\\n x 6-Mercaptopurine—Purine derivatives–\\ncompetitive attachment to enzymatic catalytic \\nsite.\\n x Gemcitabine (2’, 2’ – fluorodeoxy cytabidine) \\nis a new agent used against ovarian, breast and \\ncervical carcinoma.\\nC. Antibiotics: These are cell cycle non-specific \\nagents. They prevent DNA replication, causes \\nsingle and double stranded DNA break, e.g. \\nactinomycin D, bleomycin, doxorubicin,  \\nmitomycin C.\\nD. Plant Derivatives and Taxanes: These are \\ncell cycle specific agents. They act as spindle \\npoison and cause arrest of mitosis at metaphase. \\nVincristine and vinblastin (from plant Vinca rosea). \\n  Taxanes are obtained from the bark of \\npacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia). Important \\nmembers of this group are paclitaxel (taxol) and \\ndocetaxol (synthetic). Taxanes act to disturb the \\nnormal assembly, disassembly and stabilization \\nof microtubules. The camptothecin analogs  \\n(topotecan and irinotecan) inhibit topoisomerase-1, \\nthereby caues single stranded DNA break.\\n Other plant derivaties: Etoposide.\\nE. Hormones: The drugs induce regression of a \\nhormone responsive tumor and also increase \\nanabolic processes.\\n Progesterone preparations, e.g. hydroxyproges-\\nterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, \\nmegestrol acetate.\\n Antiestrogen—tamoxifen acts by competitive \\nreceptor binding—thus helpful in estrogen \\ndependent tumors.\\nCh-30.indd   513 15-11-2013   17:14:58'),\n",

Miscellaneous:\\n x Hexamethylamine—acts like antimetabolite.\\n x Hydroxyurea—increases radiosensitivity of \\nmalignant tissue.\\nG. Biological: Interferon, Müllerian inhibiting \\nfactor—they act by improving the host immune \\ndefense.\\ntoxIcItY: The toxic reactions depend on the type of \\ndrug used, the method of administration, its dosage \\nand general condition of the patient. The toxic \\nreactions are tabulated in Table 30.5.\\nroutE oF AdmInIstr AtIon\\nOral: Alkylating drugs are mainly used orally. The \\nintermittent therapy allows recovery of normal cells.\\nParenteral: Administration (intravenous – commonly, \\nintra-arterial) at interval of 1-4 weeks allows bone \\nmarrow to recover.\\nIntraperitoneal: Systemic administration is more \\neffective. Drug penetration will be only 3-6 cells deep.\\nObjectives of chemotherapy: (i) as a primary treatment \\nof cancer, (ii) as an adjunct to radiation therapy, (iii) \\nas a neoadjuvant therapy, used for advanced disease \\nfollowing which additional treatment is planned, (iv) \\nby direct instillation (intrapentoneal chemotherapy).\\nMeans to Assess the Response of Chemotherapy: \\n(i) clinical and physical examination, (ii) assessing \\nby imaging studies, e.g. CT or MRI, (iii) serial \\nmeasurement of specific tumor markers (i.e. CA \\n125 for epithelial ovarian cancer, β-hCG for GTN),  \\n(iv) detection of hyper metabolic state by PET (p. 119).\\nResponse evaluation criteria in solid tumors:   \\n(i) CR (complete response): Disappearance of all \\ntarget lesions. (ii) PR (partial response): 30 percent \\ndecrease in greatest diameter of tumor. (iii) PD \\n(progressive disease): 20 percent increase in greatest \\ndiameter of tumor. (iv) SD (stable disease): Small \\nchange that do not meet the above criteria. \\nPrEtrEAtmEnt EvAluAtIon: Chemotherapeutic \\nagents are highly toxic to the erythropoietic system, \\nbone marrow in particular. The drugs are mostly \\nmetabolized in the liver and are excreted through the \\nkidneys. The patients are also immunocompromised \\nand as such, any source of infection is to be treated. \\nPretreatment evaluation of all the important organ \\nfunction is of paramount importance. \\n y Hematological—complete hemogram and platelet \\ncount (> 100,000).\\n y Serum—electrolytes.\\n y Renal functions—serum urea, uric acid, creatinine \\nand creatinine clearance (especially when cisplatin \\nis used).\\n y Liver functions—serum proteins, liver enzymes, \\nbilirubin.\\n y Cardiac function—baseline ECG and ventricular \\nejection fraction when cardiotoxic drug \\n(doxorubicin) is used.\\n y Pulmonary function—when bleomycin is used.\\n y Throat swab, urine for culture and sensitivity.\\ncAlcul AtIon oF  dosE : The dose of a  \\nchemotherapeutic agent is usually calculated as \\nsquare meter of body surface area. It provides a better \\nmeasure of potential toxicity than body weight. The \\nsurface area closely reflects cardiac output and \\nblood flow. There is minimal change of surface area \\nduring entire course of therapy compared to body \\nweight. Nomogram is used for calculating body \\nsurface area of adults (p. 665).\\nusE  oF  druGs :  A schematic presentation of \\ncommonly used chemotherapy agents, type of \\nneoplasm their average dosage, route of therapy, \\ntoxicity and precaution of use is made in Table 30.5, \\n30.6 and 30.7. It should be noted that this schedule \\nis flexible and treatment must be individualized \\naccording to patient. \\nIt is imperative that all cases undergoing \\nchemotherapy should be monitored. This process \\nshould include recognition of evidences of \\nretrogression of the disease by changes in clinical, \\nbiophysical and biochemical markers. Hematological \\nprofile must be checked at regular intervals (see \\nabove). The systemic changes should reach just short \\nof irreversible toxicity for optimum benefit. Minor \\ncomplications like nausea, vomiting,  alopecia, \\nglossitis should not preclude full treatment \\nprotocol. The benefits are to be weighed against \\ntoxic effects. Explaining the situation clearly helps \\nin patient compliance and improves ultimate result.\\nText matter contd. on pg. 519\\nCh-30.indd   514 15-11-2013   17:14:58'),\n",

Well-defined cancer family syndromes with \\nautosomal dominant inheritance pattern have been described \\n(see p. 371). When life-time risk of ovarian cancer in the \\npopulation as a whole is 1.4 percent, it is about 5 percent \\nwhen one first degree relative is affected and it rises to 7 \\npercent when two or more first degree relatives are affected.\\nGenetic basis of ovarian and breast malignancy have \\nbeen explained with the mutation of the BRCA–1 gene on \\nchromosome 17q and BRCA–2 gene on chromosome 13 q. \\nThree types of genes (oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes \\nand mutator genes) are involved with malignant change. \\nPoint mutation, deletion and insertion are the important \\nchanges observed in malignancy.\\nOncogenes are dominant whereas tumor suppressor genes \\n(p.53) are recessive in function at cellular level. Oncogene \\nactivate cell proliferation to malignant behavior whereas \\ntumor suppressor genes (BRCA–1) restrain cell growth. \\nHowever, majority of ovarian cancers are not associated \\nwith familial predisposition.

It travels with the speed of light. For \\ntherapeutic purpose, radium and cesium are commonly used.\\n \\uf086 Effect of radiation at a point varies inversely as the square of the distance from the source (Inverse Square Law).\\n \\uf086 Brachytherapy is the common form of radiation therapy especially when the tumor volume is small. After-\\nloading technique is the modern development. Teletherapy is used to deliver to homogeneous radiation dose \\nto a large volume of tumor.\\n Rad is the absorbed dose. Recently, the unit gray (Joule/kg) is used. One centigray (cGy) is equivalent to one \\nrad.\\n \\uf086 Biological effects of radiation are due to fast electron, that ionizes molecules to produce free radicals. Target \\nfor radiation injury is DNA. Tumor tissue recovers from radiation damage more slowly compared to normal \\ntissue. Each delivered radiation dose kills a constant fraction of human cells. Oxygen can cause radiation \\ninduced DNA damage permanent. \\n Radiocurability of a tumor depends upon the biological behavior of the cells. It is not identical to radiosensitivity \\nwhich depends several factors (see p. 509).\\n There may be localized or systemic radiation reactions for which appropriate therapy is needed. Early reaction \\nis curable but the late reactions produce severe morbidity. Radiation reaction commonly affects GI tract, bone \\nmarrow and bladder (see p. 508).\\n \\uf086 The cell replication cycle consists of M (mitosis), G1 (RNA and protein synthesis), S (DNA synthesis) and G2 \\n(RNA and protein synthesis) phases. Cells, not in the replication cycle, are in G0 phase (p. 511). Diving tumor \\ncells (M phase) are most sensitive to cytotoxic agents. Radiation acts on cells primarily in M phase.\\n \\uf086 Large tumors have smaller growth fractions and longer mass doubling time. Cytotoxic agents act on various \\nphases of the cell cycle. They primarily affect rapidly proliferating cells. Rapidly growing tumors are more \\ncurable to treatment. Drugs commonly used are alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antibiotics, plant alkaloids, \\nand hormones. Toxic effects varies from slight to more severe one, even to the extent of death (p. 515, 516).\\n \\uf086 Cisplatin is more nephrotoxic and myelosuppressive compared to carboplatin. Doxorubicin is cardiotoxic. \\nBleomycin is associated with pulmonary toxicity. Vincristine and cisplatin cause peripheral neurotoxicity. \\nAlopecia can occur with any chemotherapy. Taxol (paclitaxel and docetaxel) is a powerful antineoplastic agent \\nthat disrupts microtubule function (polymerization) (see p. 513).\\nContd...\\n x It should be produced only by the tumor cells.\\n x It should be specific.\\n x Its measurement either in the blood or urine \\nshould be sensitive enough to detect microscopic \\nor subclinical disease.\\n x Tumor markers are used to monitor the response \\nof therapy. Ideally the antigen (tumor marker) \\nlevel should represent the tumor volume correctly. \\nProgressive rise in marker value indicates \\nineffective chemotherapy.\\n x The assay should be inexpensive and acceptable.\\nThe tumor marker should not only indicate the \\npresence but also the site of tumor origin.\\nTumor marker is useful in screening, diagnosis \\nand management of a case and for follow-up. \\nHowever, the detection of tumor marker is seldom \\nmade before the cell population becomes 1010.\\nThe role of serum CA–125 in the evaluation \\nof disease (ovarian carcinoma) progression and \\nregression is invaluable. Similarly, serum β-hCG is \\nuseful in the diagnosis, management and follow up \\nof cases with GTN.

It gives a synergistic effect by acting at different cell sites and reduces the \\ndevelopment of drug resistance (see p. 513).\\n \\uf086 Multiple chemotherapeutic agents have been used to kill cancer cells. They have also been used to sensitize \\ncells to radiation. Chemoradiation improves outcome especially with squamous cell cancers.\\n \\uf086 Pretreatment evaluation and proper monitoring during therapy are mandatory to prevent or minimize the \\ntoxicity (see p. 514). Growth factors or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are used to prevent hemorrhagic \\ntoxicity of chemotherapy.\\n \\uf086 Immunotherapy in malignancy—is being explored recently. Cytokines (polypeptides) have antitumor and \\nimmune stimulating effects. Augmentation of immune system is achieved by active (interferon, IL-2) and \\npassive (LAK cells) immunotherapy.\\n \\uf086 Tumor markers indicate the presence and also the site of tumor origin.

Hormones \\ntravel to distant cells to have its desired effects.\\nFactors: Factors are substances that modulate cell function \\nand proliferation by acting upon the cell membrane \\nreceptors. They act locally (unlike the hormones) by \\nautocrine and paracrine mechanism.\\nAnalogues: An analogue is a synthetic substance with \\na structure mostly similar to a natural one but differing \\nfrom it in certain component. It may have agonist and/\\nor antagonist function at the cellular level. GnRH analog \\nacts as an agonist (upregulation) initially but on chronic \\ntherapy, it antagonises (downregulation) the pituitary \\nGnRH receptors.\\nAgonists: Agonist is a substance that has increased affinity \\nfor cell receptors and it stimulates the cellular physiological \\nresponse.\\nAntagonists : An antagonist tends to nullify the action of \\nanother substance binding on its receptor without eliciting \\na biological response. There is a blockage of receptor \\nresponse. Tamoxifen blocks estrogen receptor whereas \\nmifepristone blocks progesterone receptors.\\nBecause of relative lack of receptor specificity, an \\nantagonist for one class of hormone can have an antagonistic \\neffect on another class of hormone.\\nAntagonists may have adverse effects apart from the \\nintended use.\\ncellular FuNctioN\\nA cell function is modulated by any of the three ways:\\nEndocrine when a hormone in circulation (blood or \\nlymph) regulates the function of a cell at a distant site.\\nParacrine function is when a regulating substance \\ndiffuses from one cell to a contiguous cell (intercellular) \\nand modulates the cell function. Insulin-like growth factor-II \\n(IGF-II) is produced by the theca cells of ovary. It stimulates \\ngranulosa cell proliferation when it diffuses to it.\\nAutocrine  function is explained when \\na regulating substance produced by a cell \\nact upon the receptor on the same cell. It \\nmodulates the function of the same cell \\n(intracellular). IGF-II is said to have autocrine \\nfunction when it is produced by and acts on \\nluteinized granulosa cells.\\niNtroductioN\\nConsiderable advancement has been made in the \\nunderstanding of chemistry and pharmacology of new \\ncompounds that modulate and influence the function \\nof many endogenous hormones. Once the structure \\nof natural hormones is defined, it becomes possible \\nto synthesize not only the hormones themselves, but \\nalso their agonists or antagonists.

The maximal response \\nis observed at 15–30 minutes for LH and 30–60 \\nminutes for FSH.The absence of response usually \\ndenotes pituitary fault. However, the result may \\nnot be unequivocal and as such, requires cautious \\ninterpretation.\\nTherapeutic: The pulsatile nature of hypothalamic \\nGnRH in the control of gonadotropin secretion affords \\na physiological basis for the activation of pituitary \\ngonadal axis.\\nInduction of ovulation: It is suitable in cases with\\nidiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who \\nhave failed to respond with clomiphene. Pulsatile \\nadministration of GnRH (2.5 to 20 µg/pulse) at a \\nconstant interval (60–90 min) induces ovulation \\neffectively. GnRH therapy results follicular growth \\nand development similar to a normal cycle. In \\nhypothalamic causes of anovulation, GnRH is \\nmost effective. For intravenous route, portable \\nminipump is used. For subcutaneous route high \\ndose (20 µg) is needed. The main advantages of \\npulsatile administration are lower incidence of \\nhyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancy \\nwhen compared to hMG.\\nOther uses through activation of Pituitary-\\nGonadal Axis:\\n� Delayed puberty—to activate the pituitary \\ngonadal axis (p. 54).\\n� Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (p. 515) \\nto stimulate HPO axis for ovarian follicular \\ndevelopment.\\n� Cryptorchidism.\\ngnrh aNalogues (agonists and antagonists) have \\nbeen synthesized by substitution of amino acids at \\ndifferent positions of GnRH molecule. This is done \\nto overcome the short half-life, as well as to alter the \\nfunctions of GnRH (see p. 67). GnRH agonists have \\nlonger half lives (3–8 hours) and greater potencies \\n(15–200 times).\\n\\uf0be GnRH agonist is produced when there is \\nsubstitution of amino acids at sixth and tenth \\npositions (see Fig. 7.1A, p. 67). This makes GnRH \\nmore stable with increased receptor affinity.\\nMode of action: Initially there is stimulation of \\nanterior pituitary resulting in increased secretion of \\nFSH and LH (upregulation). This is called flare \\neffect. After 1–3 weeks, there is profound suppression \\nof secretion (downregulation) due to loss of pituitary \\nGnRH receptor sensitivity. This leads to a fall in \\npituitary gonadotropic hormones—LH and FSH and \\nconsequently the gonadal secretion (hypogonadotropic \\nhypogonadal state).

The clinical features appear about 3–6 days \\nafter the ovulating dose of hCG is administered. \\nIt is an iatrogenic and potentially a life-threatening \\ncomplication of superovulation.\\nrisk factors for ohss are: Young age < 30 years, \\nPCOS, Serum E2 >2500 pg/ml, rapidly rising serum \\nE2 levels (>75% rise from previous day), ovarian \\n‘necklace sign’ on USG (multiple small follicles), \\nhCG administration and multiple pregnancy.  \\nPathophysiology is poorly understood. Increased \\ncapillary permeability leads to leakage of fluid from \\nthe peritoneal and ovarian surfaces.

The ovulation is not \\nsuppressed. Use of LNG-IUD and progestin implant \\n(implanan) is found to be effective in cases with pelvic \\nendometriosis or adenomyosis.\\nLuteal phase defect (LPD) (see p. 247): In a \\nproven case, daily intramuscular injection of \\n12.5 mg progesterone in oil, beginning 2–3 days \\nafter the ovulation until menstruation occurs or if \\nconception has taken place, until 10–12 weeks of \\ngestation.

Well- \\ndifferentiated grade I endometrial carcinoma \\nhas got the highest number of receptors. These \\ncases are suitable for progestogen therapy. Recurrent \\nendometrial carcinoma having good steroid receptor \\nstatus is also suitable.\\nDose: 17α hydroxyprogesterone caproate 1000 mg \\nIM daily for 1 week, weekly for 3 months and \\nthereafter at interval of 2 weeks for 1 year. Alter-\\nnatively, medroxyprogesterone acetate 400 mg IM. \\nweekly for 3 months and then every 2 weeks for \\n1 year. \\nPremenstrual syndrome (see p. 185): Controversy \\nexists with the hypothesis that progesterone deficiency \\nmay be the cause. So progestogens have been tried to \\nrelieve the symptoms. Dydrogesterone 5 mg twice \\ndaily from day 5 for 20 days in each cycle for 3–6 \\ncycles may be tried.\\nLuteal support: It is usually given on the day after \\noocyte retrieval for ART (see p. 251). Progesterone is \\nused in any of these forms. • Progesterone in oil 50 mg \\nIM daily. • Vaginal suppository 200 mg twice daily or \\n• Micronized progesterone orally 200 mg twice daily. \\nIt is usually continued for about 14 days (see p. 252). \\nPostponement of menstruation: In order to post-\\npone the menstruation, norethisterone preparation \\n5 mg tab thrice daily is to be taken at least 3 days prior \\nto the expected date of menstruation. This should be \\ncontinued till such time when the patient wishes to have \\nher period. The period usually starts after 48–72 hours. \\nThis should not be taken casually, as it may disturb \\nthe menstrual pattern.

It is \\nassociated with recurrent miscarriage and subfertility. \\nAfter the diagnosis is established by RIA of TSH, T4\\nand T 3, substitution therapy with eltroxin is given \\norally as per the need (see p. 243).\\nKEY POINTS\\n \\uf086 GnRH stimulation is used to differentiate an amenorrhea of pituitary or hypothalamic in origin. The absence \\nof response usually denotes pituitary fault.\\n \\uf086 For induction of ovulation, GnRH is effective in cases of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\\n \\uf086 GnRH analogues (agonists and antagonists) have been synthesized by substitution of amino acids at different \\nposition of GnRH molecule (p. 525). GnRH antagonists has got some advantages over GnRH agonist (Table 31.2).\\n \\uf086 The GnRH analogues stop the normal pattern of GnRH secretion leading to loss of pituitary GnRH receptors and \\nthereby down regulation. This leads to fall in pituitary gonadotropins and consequently the gonadal secretion. \\nThe net effect is of medical hypophysectomy.\\n \\uf086 GnRH analogues are used for superovulation in IVF program and in therapeutic considerations to all conditions \\nrelated to high estrogen level such as precocious puberty, endometriosis, ﬁ  broid, DUB, breast carcinoma and \\nthe alike. In achieving superovulation, either a long protocol or a short protocol regimen is followed under \\nproper monitoring.\\n \\uf086 Gonadotropic hormones act on the ovaries to induce ovulation. Both FSH and LH (Pergonal) or pure FSH \\n(Metrodin) are available and are obtained from the urine of postmenopausal women. hCG is obtained from \\nthe urine of pregnant women.\\n Gonadotropins are expensive and require close monitoring not only for induction of ovulation but also to prevent \\nhyperstimulation syndrome. The induction of ovulation with gonadotropins is indicated in hypogonadotropic \\nhypogonadism with or without amenorrhea and in failed clomiphene, in patients with PCOS.\\n There is increased incidence of multiple pregnancy (20–30%) and hyperstimulation syndrome (1–20%).\\n \\uf086 Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome usually appears about 3–6 days after the ovulating dose of hCG.\\n Increased vascular permeability due to VEGF and activation of NO system, leads to leakage of ﬂ  uid from \\nperitoneal and ovarian surfaces. OHSS may be mild (10–20%), moderate (5–10%) or severe (1–2%) (p. 529).\\n In severe cases, correction of hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic acidosis and blood coagulopathy \\nhave to be done. Intensive care monitoring may be needed for a few (p. 529, 530).\\n \\uf086 Ovarian reserve means the quantity as well as quality of the follicles present in the ovary. There are tests to \\ndetermine the ovarian reserve. Poor ovarian reserve indicates poor outcome following  stimulation of ovulation \\n(p. 528).\\n \\uf086 Danazol is strictly an anti-gonadotropin but acts as an androgen agonist. Its use is wide like that of GnRH \\nanalogues. It should be started in the early follicular phase and barrier methods of contraception should be used.\\n The side effects are due to hypoestrogenic, androgenic and metabolic changes (see Table 31.4). The drug should \\nbe discontinued, if the patient develops hirsutism or hoarseness of voice.\\n \\uf086 Gestrinone is an androgen agonist and progesterone agonist-antagonist.

In the hypothalamus, it binds to the estrogen receptors preventing the negative \\nfeedback effect of endogenous estrogens to GnRH resulting in more synthesis of gonadotropins.\\n \\uf086 Tamoxifen is also an anti-estrogen and is widely used in benign breast disease.

This may cause confusion in \\nthe determination of sex at birth. The details have \\nbeen mentioned in Chapter 27 (Fig. 27.1).\\nManagement: In the idiopathic group, no treatment \\nis required. However, an apparently female child \\nwith enlarged phallus and impalpable gonads requires \\nat least estimation of serum 17-OHP, urinary 17 \\nketosteroid and chromosomal analysis to rule out \\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia (see p. 440) (Fig. 32.1).\\nGenital Crisis : It includes spectrum of disorders \\nnoticed within few days of birth. It is due to the effect \\nof passive estrogenic stimulation, which has passed \\nacross the placenta from the mother. The presence \\nof the estrogen so obtained produces changes in the \\nendometrium and other target tissues such as breasts \\nand cervical glands.\\nBleeding per vaginum: It usually occurs within \\n10 days following birth; mostly blood stained but, at \\ntimes, frank bleeding. This is due to decline in level of \\nestrogen, which is unable to support the endometrium, \\nresulting in withdrawal bleeding. There is no cause \\nfor concern.\\nEnlarged breasts: Due to effect of maternal estrogen \\nand progesterone, there may be some development of \\nduct and alveolar system of the breasts. Withdrawal of \\nhormonal suppression of prolactin leads to discharge \\nfrom the nipple called ‘witch’s milk’. No treatment is \\nrequired; only assurance is enough.\\nNeonatal leucorrhea: This is due to excessive \\nsecretion of cervical mucus from the hypertrophied \\ncervical glands under the influence of estrogen.\\nLabial adhesion (adhesive vulvitis) is the condition \\nwhen the labia minora have adhered together. \\nCauses: Commonly, it is due to mild infection of the \\nvulva which is favoured by lack of local defense due \\nto absence of estrogen. There is denudation of the \\nsurface epithelium of the labia minora → adhesions.\\nThe adhesions of the labia minora start from behind \\nforward leaving a small opening at the foremost tip \\nthrough which urine escapes out.\\nRarely, it may be a manifestation of minor form \\nof masculinization following maternal intake of \\nandrogen during pregnancy.\\nDiagnosis: The condition usually appears within 2–3 \\nyears of birth. The mother usually, anxious about the \\nentity, brings to the notice of the physician for not \\nvisualizing the vaginal opening. The adhesions may \\ncause difficulty in micturition or periodic attacks of \\nurinary tract infection. There may be inflammation of \\nthe vestibule and vagina.\\nExamination reveals adhesions of labia minora \\nobliterating the vaginal opening and, at times, even \\nthe external urethral meatus (Fig. 32.2A).

This is a benign condition. In these \\ngirls, the junction between the müllerian ducts and the \\nsino-vaginal bulb may not be sharply demarketed. As \\nthe Müllerian elements invade the sino-vaginal bulb, \\nremnants may remain as areas of adenosis in adult \\nvagina. The columnar epithelium of the endocervix \\nextends onto the ectocervix and also variable \\npart of the vaginal fornices. There is thus copious \\nvaginal secretion from the columnar epithelium. The \\npathology regresses spontaneously in due course of \\ntime.

However, a short resume is  \\npresented here.\\nThe physiologic basis involved in normal vaginal \\nsecretion is dependent on the endogenous estrogen \\nlevel. With the rising estrogen level, there is abundant \\nsecretory activity of the endocervical glands and \\nthe superficial vaginal epithelium becomes rich in \\nglycogen (see p. 7, 126).\\nThe mucoid secretion from the cervical glands is \\nnormally small in amount. The carbohydrate radicle \\nof the glycoprotein mucin is split off and fermented \\ninto lactic acid. If however, the mucus is secreted in \\nexcess, it pours out at the vulva.\\nThe excessive secretion is due to:\\n h Physiologic excess\\n h Cervical cause (cervical leucorrhea)\\n h Vaginal cause (vaginal leucorrhea)\\nPhysiologic excess: The normal secretion is expected \\nto increase in conditions when the estrogen levels \\nbecome high. Such conditions are :\\nDuring puberty—Increased levels of endogenous \\nestrogen lead to marked overgrowth of the endo-\\ncervical epithelium which may encroach onto the \\nectocervix producing congenital ectopy (erosion) → \\nincreased secretion.\\nDuring menstrual cycle\\n \\x99 Around ovulation—Peak rise of estrogen → \\nincrease in secretory activity of the cervical \\nglands.\\n \\x99 Premenstrual pelvic congestion and increased \\nmucus secretion from the hypertrophied endome-\\ntrial glands.\\nPregnancy—There is hyperestrinism with increased \\nvascularity. This leads to increased vaginal transudate \\nand cervical gland secretion.\\nDuring sexual excitement, when there is abundant \\nsecretion from the Bartholin’s glands.\\nCervical cause: Non-infective cervical lesion may \\nproduce excessive secretion, which pours out at the \\nvulva. Such lesions are—cervical ectopy, chronic \\ncervicitis, mucous polyp and ectropion (cervical \\nglands are exposed to the vagina).\\nVaginal cause:  Increased vaginal transudation \\noccurs in conditions associated with increased \\npelvic congestion. The conditions are uterine \\nprolapse, acquired retroverted uterus, chronic pelvic \\ninflammation, ‘pill’ use and vaginal adenosis. Ill \\nhealth is one of the important causes of excessive \\ndischarge.

Pelvic pain is a common symptom \\nin gynecology. It may be present in acute form or in \\nchronic form. It should be remembered that the pain \\nis just a symptom of an underlying disorder. Whereas, \\nit is often easy to find out the underlying cause of \\nacute pain, it is often difficult to find out the cause \\nof chronic pelvic pain. Sensation of pain is found \\nto depend on many factors in an individual: e.g. \\nsubjective feel, emotional status,  genetic factors, \\nexperience, gender , pain threshold,  anxiety and \\nexpectations. Women have a lower pain threshold \\nand tolerance. \\nNEuROPHYSIOLOGY  Of PAIN\\nImpulse generated due to depolarization of a peri-\\npheral nerve ending (Transduction) → Transmiss-\\nion of the nerve impulse →  Modulation (control \\nof impulse transmission to neurones by neurotrans-\\nmitters) → perception of pain.\\nOrgans Site of referred pain\\nbody of uterus Hypogastrium, anterior and \\nmedial aspect of thighs\\nfallopian tubes  \\nand ovaries\\nAbove the mid-inguinal point\\ncervix Upper sacral region\\nUterosacral ligament lower sacral region\\ntABLE 33.3  LOCALIz AtION Of REfERRED  PAIN\\nUnlike somatic structures, which are well-\\nrepresented in the cerebral cortex in terms of \\nlocalization, visceral structures are poorly localized \\nin the cerebral cortex. Thus, the pain arising from \\nthe pelvic organs is often localized not to the \\norgan but referred to the skin area supplied by \\nthe same spinal nerve. Various neuromodulators \\n(prostaglandins, endorphins) and neurotransmitters \\n(norepinephrine, serotonin) are involved to modify the \\npain sensation in the brain. Visceral pain may be due \\nto distension, stretching, hypoxia, necrosis, chemical \\nirritants or inflammation of the viscera. Pelvic pain \\nmay be splanchnic or referred. One finger ‘trigger \\npoint’ tenderness is suggestive of nerve entrapment \\n(ilioinguinal). Similarly ‘ovarian point’ tenderness \\nsuggests pelvic congestion syndrome (p. 181).\\nACutE PELVIC PAIN: Acute pain is of short duration \\nand generally the symptoms are proportionate to \\nthe extent of tissue damage. In chronic pelvic pain, \\nthe onset is insidious and the degree of pain is not \\nproportionate to the extent of structural tissue damage.  \\nMost often, the basic mechanism of acute pain is \\ndue to irritation of the peritoneum by either blood or \\ninfection.

Mobile retroverted \\nuterus does not produce backache.\\nChronic pelvic infection: Chronic PID producing \\nadhesions and TO mass formation may be responsible \\nfor backache. There are associated menstrual \\nabnormalities and dyspareunia. Chronic cervicitis \\nproduces backache by parametritis.\\nEndometriosis: Endometriosis involving the pelvic \\nperitoneum, uterosacral ligament or rectovaginal \\nseptum produces backache and deep dyspareunia \\n(see p. 307).\\nNeoplasm: Benign neoplasm like ovarian tumor \\nor fibroid will not ordinarily produce backache. \\nHowever, cervical or broad ligament fibroid can cause \\nbackache by producing pressure on the nerve routes \\nover the sacrum.\\nPelvic malignancy produces backache by \\ninvolving the nerve roots, metastasis in the vertebrae \\nor involving the lateral pelvic wall.\\nBREASt  IN GYNECOLOGY\\nBreast is one of the target organs for the various \\nhormones, of particular estrogens, progesterone and \\nprolactin. As such, many a breast related complaint \\nor disease is associated with endocrine dysfunctions.\\nDevelopment: The breast develops at 6–8 weeks from \\nthe “milk ridge” which is an ectodermal thickening that \\nextends longitudinally from the axilla to groin. Pectoral \\npart of the ridge persists and the rest regresses. In the 3rd \\nmonth, a depression called “mammary pocket” appears \\nin the center of the milk ridge. Solid buds grow from the \\nmammary pocket into the underlying mesoderm at around \\nthe 5th month. During 7th to 9th month the solid buds \\ndegenerate and develop into acini. At birth the inverted \\nnipples become everted by the growth of the underlying \\nstroma. The connective tissue stroma is developed from \\nthe mesoderm.  \\nAt birth: There is only nipple with system of ducts \\nwithout alveoli. Due to maternal estrogen, the growth \\nbecomes exaggerated with occasional mucoid discharge \\n(witch milk). The involution usually is completed by 1–2 \\nweeks after birth.\\nPuberty changes (see p. 49): The breast duct growth \\nis primarily stimulated by estrogen. The alveolar cells \\nand sebaceous glands are stimulated by progesterone. \\nThe maturation of the breast components is accelerated \\nby growth hormone, adrenal hormones, thyroid hormone, \\nprolactin and insulin.\\nANAtOMY Of tHE ADuLt BREASt\\nThe breasts are bilateral glandular structures and in female, \\nconstitute accessory reproductive organs as the glands are \\nconcerned with lactation following childbirth.\\nThe shape of the breast varies in women and also in \\ndifferent periods of life.

It is a \\nmore severe form of androgen excess.Virilism may \\nbe due to adrenal hyperplasia or tumors of adrenal \\nor ovary. \\nIn female major androgens are: dehydroepian -\\ndrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), dehydroepiandroster-\\none (DHEA), androstenedione, testosterone (T) and \\ndihydrotestosterone (DHT). All androgenic activities \\nare due to T and DHT.\\nANDROGEN  SOuRCES  IN fEMALE\\nTestosterone is the second most potent androgen in \\ncirculation, the first one being dihydrotestosterone \\n(DHT). The daily production rate of testosterone in \\nnormal female is 0.2–0.3 mg.\\nApproximately, 50 percent of testosterone \\narises from peripheral conversion of prohormones, \\npredominantly androstenedione. The principal sites \\nof peripheral conversion are skin, muscle, fat, liver \\nand lungs. The adrenal glands (z. reticularis and  \\nz. fasciculata) and ovaries (theca, stroma and \\ngranulosa) contribute approximately equal amounts \\n(25%) to the circulatory levels of testosterone.\\nDehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA\\xadS) \\narises exclusively from the adrenal glands while \\nabout 50 percent of DHEA is secreted from the \\nadrenals.\\nfig. 33.4:  15 years, young obese (BMI\\u2009:\\u200934) girl with \\nexcessive growth of hair in a male distribution (face, \\nchest and inter-mammary region) \\n'),\n",

About \\n19 percent is bound loosely with albumin and only \\n1 percent of the testosterone remains free which \\nis biologically active. Normally total circulating \\ntestosterone level is 20–80 ng/dl. \\nTo exert a biological effect, testosterone (T) is \\nmetabolically converted in target tissues to dihy-\\ndrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5α-reductase. \\nDHT is the most potent androgen to stimulate the \\nhair follicles and sebaceous glands (pilosebaceous \\nunit). 3α-androstanediol glucuronide (3α -AG)  \\nis an important tissue metabolite of DHT. 3α -AG  \\nis thought to reflect the activity of the enzyme  \\n5α-reductase at tissue level.\\nT → (5α-reductase) → DHT → 3α-androstane-\\ndiol (3α -A) → 3 α-androstanediol glucuronide  \\n(3α-AG).\\nTherefore, the biochemical marker for each andro-\\ngen compartment is different.

This is followed by activation of the enzyme \\n5α-reductase. This will convert testosterone to most potent \\nandrogen—dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenediol \\nwhich stimulate proliferation and growth of terminal hair \\n(anagen phase).

It is \\nnonpurulent, non-offensive and never causes pruritus.\\n The excess normal secretion occurs during puberty, menstrual cycle (around ovulation and premenstrual), \\npregnancy and sexual excitement. Abnormal vaginal discharge is mainly infective in origin (see Table 33.2).\\n Improvement of general health, sympathetic attitude towards ailments, local hygiene and appropriate therapy \\nfor the local ailments are enough to cure the state.\\n h Pruritus means sense of itching. It does not produce pain; nor there is any local tenderness.\\n Local skin lesions, vaginal discharge, allergy, intestinal worms or diabetes are some of the important causes.\\nAppropriate therapy is to be instituted depending upon the factors involved. Vulvectomy is not the treatment \\nto cure pruritus.\\n h The significance of postmenopausal bleeding should not be underestimated. About one-third of the cases are \\ndue to pelvic malignancy, the commonest being uterine (Table 33.8).\\n Apart from routine use of gynecological examination, the special investigations include cytology, transvaginal \\nsonography, fractional curettage, hysteroscopic evaluation and/or laparoscopy. Even if no cause is detected, \\nrecurrence or persistent uterine bleeding dictates hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\\n h Pain arising from the pelvic organs is often localized not to the organ but referred to the skin area supplied by \\nthe same spinal nerve (Table 33.3).\\n The basic mechanism of acute pain is due to irritation of the peritoneum by either blood or infection.\\n Apart from history and clinical examination, the investigations to pinpoint the diagnosis of acute pelvic \\npain include—examination of blood for hematocrit, midstream urine examination for UTI and urine for \\nimmunological test for pregnancy (Table 33.4). The diagnosis is established in most cases.\\n Management in cases of definite diagnosis includes either immediate laparotomy or institution of medical \\ntherapy. In doubtful cases, diagnostic laparoscopy and observation are of help (Table 33.5).\\n Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as six months or more of constant or intermittent pain (nonmenstrual \\npain) localized in the pelvis or lower back severe enough to cause functional disability or requiring medical or \\nsurgical treatment. CPP is often without any visible pathology (Table 33.6). Incidental detection of pathology \\nmay not be the cause of pain. Laparoscopy is done both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes as “one-stop” \\nprocedure. In the absence of definite pathology, medical management of pain should be tried first.  '),\n",

Minimal surgery includes laser therapy in pelvic endometriosis and adhesiolysis \\nendoscopically. Hysterectomy should be contemplated judiciously.\\n h Trapped or residual ovarian syndrome is manifested with chronic pelvic pain. The pain arises from the ovaries \\n(preserved during hysterectomy) due to tension within the growing follicle or due to periovarian adhesions.  \\nThe chronic pelvic pain in ovarian remnant syndrome is due to the remnant of ovarian cortical tissue, left behind \\nunintendedly following a difficult oophorectomy.\\n h The backache pointed by fingertip is not of gynecologic origin. The pain in prolapse subsides when the patient \\nis at rest and aggravates on standing. Mobile retroverted uterus does not produce backache.\\n h Breast carcinoma is one of the leading cause of death among female malignancies.\\n The screening includes—breast self-examination, clinical breast examination, imaging studies and breast biopsy \\n(see p. 564). Baseline mammogram is to be done at 40 years. Mammography along with physical examination \\nis to be done annually from the age of 40 and earlier in high risk group.\\n Irrespective of mammographic findings, presence of any suspicious mass suggests biopsy.\\n h FNAC is a rapid diagnostic method with high degree of accuracy. Ultrasound guided procedure allows the \\nneedle tip to reach the exact site.\\n High risk factors for breast carcinoma are many (Table 33.9). Mutations in BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes (tumor \\nsuppressor genes) account for familial breast cancer (5%), which has an early age onset. \\n h Causes of bloody nipple discharge are (Table 33.11) malignancy, intraductal papilloma, fibrocystic disease and \\nduct ectasia. Purulent discharge is due to infection and serous or sticky discharge is due to fibrocystic disease.\\n h Female sexual dysfunction includes different disorders (p. 565). Dyspareunia means that the coital act is difficult \\nand or painful. Apareunia is inability to practice coitus. Causes of deep dyspareunia are pelvic endometriosis, \\nchronic cervicitis, chronic PID, fixed retroverted uterus or prolapsed ovary in the pouch of Douglas.\\n h Prior to gynecological examination, bladder must be kept empty. Full bladder should be excluded first in the \\ndifferential diagnosis of abdominopelvic lump; similarly, pregnancy has to be excluded in childbearing period \\nirrespective of the status of the women (Table 33.12)—married, unmarried, widow, divorced or separated.\\n h The principal sources of androgen in female are peripheral (50%), ovaries and adrenals (p. 572 – flow chart).  \\nMost of the testosterone (80%) in the circulation is bound to SHBG; 19 percent is bound with albumin and 1 \\npercent remains free which is biologically active.\\n In the pillosebaceous unit, the testosterone is converted into potent dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme  \\n5 a reductase. Hirsutism may be associated with excess androgen production either form the ovaries or adrenals \\nor excess stimulation of the hair follicles. Virilism is almost always associated with hirsutism except at birth \\nbut hirsutism may not be associated with virilism.\\n Causes of hirsutism may be in the adrenals, ovaries, exogenous drug therapy or idiopathic (Table 33.13).\\n In adrenal hyperplasia, 17-hydroxyprogesterone is elevated; in adrenal tumor, DHEA-S is elevated; in ovarian \\ntumour, testosterone is elevated and in PCOS, LH : FSH ratio is increased. Dexamethasone suppression test \\nis positive in adrenal hyperplasia but not in tumor. Sonography, CT scan, MRI, IVP and laparoscopy may be \\nextended to exclude organic lesion (Table 33.14).\\n h For each major compartment of androgen source, one biochemical marker is used.

Women with a serum testosterone level > 200 ng/dL needs \\ninvestigations (DHEA-S, 17-OHP, USG, CT and MRI) to exclude tumors (ovary, adrenal) or CAH.\\n h Treatment of hirsutism depends on the source of excess androgen (see Table 33.15). Oral contraceptive therapy \\nis instituted when serum testosterone is elevated (ovarian androgen). Dexamethasone is the drug of choice \\nwhen DHEA-S is elevated (adrenal androgen). Antiandrogens (see p. 576) are used when neither is elevated \\n(peripheral androgen). Most women (80%) with idiopathic hirsutism have elavated levels of 3a–AG. The best \\ntreatment for such a woman is antiandrogen, spironolactone.\\n h Antiandrogens should be continued for a minimum of 3 months before any response is observed. This is due \\nto the length of hair growth cycle. While the antiandrogen inhibits the growth of new hair follicle, it fails to \\nremove the hair that is already present.\\n h Source of excess androgen may have to be removed surgically (see Table 33.14). Removal of hair is done by \\nbleaching, twitching, epilation or electrolysis.\\n h Any medical management of hirsutism needs at least 6 months  to get the benefits of therapy. This is because  \\nthe life cycle of a hair follicle is 6 months.\\n h Women having mild hirsutism of long duration, regular menses, no virilization, require no investigations. They \\nmay be treated with COCs or COCs containing drospirenone or desogestrel.\\n h Prolactin is the most important hormone, involved in the pathophysiology of galactorrhea.\\n h Common causes are pituitary microadenoma (smaller than 10 mm), hypothalamic pathology , drug \\ntherapy (reserpine, OC, psychotropic agents, methyldopa, etc.) and primary hypothyroidism (see ch. 28).  \\nSerum prolactin level of > 100 ng/mL is too often associated with tumor (prolactinoma).\\n h Bromocriptine is the drug of choice for galactorrhea. Cabergoline is more effective and well tolerated compared \\nto bromocriptine. Pregnancy following bromocriptine has got no teratogenic effect on the offspring. There is \\nno increased incidence of multiple pregnancy. \\n h Most macroadenomas enlarge with time whereas most microadenomas do not. Bromocriptine shrinks 80% of \\nmacroadenomas. Surgical treatment of prolactinomas (transnasal-transsphenoidal excision) is done for women \\nwho fail to respond with medical treatment.\\n h Cabergoline is more effective and well tolerated compared to bromocriptine.\\n h An adnexal mass needs to be critically evaluated to formulate the management. Clinical examination, imaging \\nstudies, tumor markers and the genetic markers (p. 570) are helpful to distinguish a benign from a malignant \\ntumor. An adnexal mass may be followed up or may need medical or surgical intervention depending upon \\nits nature (benign or malignant), size and the patient’s age.'),\n",

The decision to operate and whether \\nit should be emergently or electively is also important. \\nThe prime objective of this chapter is to make \\nthe readers familiar with the basic information about \\ndifferent aspects of practical gynecology. While the \\ntechnical details may only concern the specialists, \\nthe beginners should be familiar with the basic \\nprinciples of operative gynecology. The interested \\nreaders may go through the available textbooks of \\noperative gynecology for further details.\\nPrEoPEr AtIVE PrEPAr AtIonS\\nThe ultimate objective of surgery is to cure the \\nailments and/or to arrive at a diagnosis, if it is done \\nfor diagnostic purpose.\\nPreoperative evaluation should include a deta-\\niled history (general, medical and surgical), a  \\ncomplete physical examination and laboratory \\ninvestigations. BMI (see chapter 9) is recorded \\nfor assessment of nutritional status. Past records of  \\nillness or surgery should be evaluated. An anes-\\nthesiologist should see the patient preoperatively. \\nA physician or other specialists may be involved \\ndepending upon the patient’s need. For any elective \\n(planned) operation, the general condition of the \\npatient must be improved, prior to operation any \\nsystemic disorder including anemia must be corrected.\\nInVEStIgAtIonS \\nThe objectives of preoperative investigations are:\\n \\x8d To evaluate the health status of an individual who \\nmay be otherwise healthy.\\n \\x8d To provide a base line information in the event of \\nany postoperative complication.\\n \\x8d To assess the severity of a pre-existing medical \\ndisorder that needs further attention.\\nThe investigations should preferably be done prior \\nto admission. \\nRationale for preoperative investigations \\nAny major gynecological surgery involves anes-\\nthesia, blood loss and disturbances in major organ \\nfunction like cardiovascular and respiratory. The \\npurpose of preoperative investigations is to assess \\nthe individual’s physiological reserve and the ability \\nto withstand the surgical stress.\\nRoutine investigations for major surgery\\n \\x84 Blood—Estimation of hemoglobin, hematocrit, \\ntotal and differential leucocyte count, platelet \\ncount, blood group and cross matching are done. \\nOther blood tests: Liver function, renal function, \\nserum electrolytes, blood sugar in aged women or \\nin complicated cases.\\n \\x84 Urine—Routine and microscopic analysis inclu-\\ndes examination for protein, sugar, casts and pus \\ncells. If the pus cells are more than 5 per high \\npower field, culture sensitivity is required.\\n \\x84 Chest X-ray (CXR) and ECG—For an otherwise \\nhealthy individual below the age of 40, these are \\nnot essential. But women above 40 years of age \\nshould preferably have cXR, EcG and serum \\nelectrolytes analysis.\\nIf there is any history of systemic disease, relevant \\ninvestigations should be carried out accordingly. \\nRelevant investigations (e.g. echocardiography, \\ncoagulation profile) should be done as indicated. \\nSpecial investigations appropriate to some lesions \\nsuch as VVF, malignancy have been mentioned in the \\nconcerned chapters.\\n'),\n",

Special cases need earlier \\nadmission. During this period, re-evaluation of the \\ncase and examination by anesthetist should be done.\\nPreoperative work-up: Enquiry should be made \\nabout the details of medical or surgical history: \\nanemia, diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, urinary \\nproblems, kidney, liver disease, jaundice, asthma, \\nmalignant disease, drug allergy, corticosteroid therapy, \\nany infection (HIV) or medication used are to be \\nnoted.\\nBenefits of preoperative evaluation are: (i) de-\\ncrease surgical morbidity, (ii) reduce preoperative \\ndelay or cancelation of surgery, (iii) optimize base \\nline health status, (iv) organize plan of anesthesia.\\nPrEoPEr AtIVE counSELIng   \\nAnd InformEd conSEnt\\nPreoperative discussion between a doctor and a patient \\n(guardian in case of minor), should be in general \\nterms.

Rigorous bowel preparation is not routinely \\nrequired unless bowel surgery is expected. However, \\nin cases where satisfactory bowel preparation  \\nis needed, osmotic oral purgation using polye-\\nthylene glycol solution (Macrogols) are used.  \\nPatient is asked to drink 1–2 liters of such mixtures. To \\navoid dehydration intravenous fluids may be needed.\\nNight sedation: To ensure good sleep at night prior \\nto the day of operation, either diazepam 5–10 mg or \\nalprazolam 0.25–0.5 mg tab is given at bed time.\\nLocal antiseptic care: Abdominal preparation— \\nRoutine shaving of the operative area before surgery \\nis not recommended. Hair clipping reduces the rate \\nof wound infection. cleaning of the operative area \\nwith soap and water is generally done by the patient. \\nThe surgically prepared area should extend from \\nthe inferior rib cage to the midthigh. The abdomen \\nis cleaned with a five minute scrub using povidone \\niodine solution before surgery.\\nVaginal operation—The vaginal preparations include \\nclipping of the pubic hair and up to middle of both the \\nthighs. Presence of active vaginal or cervical infection \\nrequires eradication prior to surgery.\\nThe perineum and the vulva are cleaned with \\nSavlon using a sponge held in a sponge forceps  \\n(Fig. 37.15). The vagina is cleaned with povidone \\niodine solution. This solution is then flushed away \\nwith sterile water poured into the vagina. Then a sterile \\nsponge on a sponge forceps is used to clean the vagina.\\nMorning medication: In consultation with \\nanesthetist, sedative like diazepam 5–10 mg orally, \\nis given about two hours prior to sending the  \\npatient to the operation theater.

Other risk factors are: Patient’s age, diabetes \\nmellitus, immunosuppression, prolonged hospital stay \\nor prolonged operation. Prophylactic antibiotic is \\naimed to maintain adequate tissue levels of antibiotics \\nfor the duration of operation. Its main disadvantage \\nis the development of antibiotic resistance.  \\nA broad spectrum antibiotic is selected to cover the \\ncommon gram-positive, gram-negative and the anaerobic \\norganisms. Generally, a third generation cephalosporin \\n(ceftriaxone 1 g) is given by slow intravenous route on \\ninduction of anesthesia. Second dose is repeated after 12 \\nhours. Inj. Metronidazole 500 µg IV 8 hourly is given to \\ncombact anaerobic infection.\\nThromboprophylaxis is to be given to reduce \\nthe risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In \\nmajor gynecological surgery, the risks of deep vein \\nthrombosis and the pulmonary embolism (PE) \\nare high. The risk of VTE are high particularly in \\npatients with age >60 years, obesity (BMI >30 kg/\\nM2), positive family/personal history, APL syndrome, \\nsevere infection, active cancer, prolonged immobility \\nor thrombophilia. A patient should be adequately \\nhydrated. Mechanical measures like compression \\nstockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, leg \\nexercises, early mobilization are recommended. Low \\nmolecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin \\nis used to reduce the risk of DVT and PE. However, \\nthere may be increased bleeding due to use of heparin.\\nPreoperative work up in the operation table\\n \\x8d IV infusion—An infusion of Ringer’s solution \\ndrip is started.\\n \\x8d Anesthesia—Local, regional or general anes-\\nthesia is administered with sole discretion of the \\nanesthetist.\\n \\x8d Position of the patient—In abdominal operation, \\nthe position is dorsal, whereas in vaginal opera-\\ntion, it is lithotomy. \\n \\x8d Antiseptic dressings: Bladder preparations: For \\nminor operations the patient voids before being \\ntaken to the operating room. For major operations, \\nsoft rubber catheter or Foley’s catheter is inser- \\nted in operating table. In vaginal operation, metal \\ncatheter is used after draping and Foley’s catheter \\nis introduced at the end of the operation and (see \\nFig. 37.6). \\n \\x8d Draping—Proper draping is done prior to surgery \\nusing sterile linen, towel and leggings (in vaginal \\noperation).

During closure \\nthe rectus tendons are united to inferior portion of \\nthe rectus sheath with interrupted sutures.\\n \\x8d Maylard incision is a true transverse muscle \\ncutting incision. The inferior epigastric vessels are \\nligated before incising the rectus. The muscles are \\napproximated during closure.\\n \\x8d Vertical (Median or Paramedian) incisions give \\ngood access to whole of abdomen with excellent \\nexposure. It spares all major nerves, vessels and \\nmuscles, as opposed to the transverse incision. It \\ngives rapid entry to the abdominal cavity.\\n� Disadvantages: It lacks all the advantages of \\ntransverse incision.\\n\\x84 drAInS are used to prevent any accumulation \\nof blood, pus, lymph, bile or intestinal secretion. \\nThey are less commonly used in gynecological \\nsurgery when hemostasis is satisfactorily achieved. \\nEarly removal of drains is done to avoid infection \\nand to improve mobilization. It is usually done by \\n2–3 days after surgery when drainage is < 100 mL \\nin 24 hours.\\n\\x84 cLoSurE  of PErItonEum:  Traditionally \\nclosure of the pelvic and parietal peritoneum \\nis done at the end of the operation to decrease \\nadhesions.

If spinal anesthesia \\nis given, the foot end is raised for about 12 hours.\\nObservation: The observation of the vital signs such \\nas pulse, respiration and blood pressure is made half \\nhourly in the initial period. The interval is gradually \\nincreased if these are found steady. Attention should \\nbe paid for any bleeding from the operated site.\\nFluid replacement: Following any major operation \\nfluid is replaced intravenously. The amount of fluid \\nto be replaced is decided upon the following factors: \\nintraoperative blood loss, operating time, urine output \\nand the volume of fluid already replaced.\\nBlood transfusion, if needed is given during \\noperation and soon after.

A sedative is prescribed at \\nnight. For this purpose, intramuscular injection of \\npethidine hydrochloride 100 mg or morphine sulfate \\n10 mg is administered at an interval of 6–8 hours. \\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (Ketorolac) \\nare also effective analgesics. In some centers, \\npatient controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion pumps \\nare used. Patient is instructed to use a preset dose \\n(1 mg) of morphine without any overdosage. Nausea \\nor vomiting may be prevented by simultaneous \\nadministration of metoclopramide 10 mg or ondan-\\nsetron 4 mg IM/IV .\\nAntibiotics: Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics as \\nmentioned in preoperative care are to be considered. \\nAlternatively, routine postoperative antibiotics are \\nprescribed. This should be administered parenterally \\nfor 48 hours followed by oral route for another 3 days.\\nBladder care:  Women having major gynecological \\nsurgery, usually a Foley’s catheter is inserted before \\nthe operation. It keeps the bladder empty through- \\nout and reduces the risk of any bladder injury. It \\nhelps to monitor urine output, reduces the risk of \\nurinary retention and pain. Generally, it is removed \\non third postoperative day. Prolonged catherization \\nis associated with urinary tract infection. catheter is \\nkept for 7–10 days in patients having any injury to the \\nbladder. Following removal of catheter, postoperative \\nurinary retention is a common problem. This is due to \\npain, spasm of the pelvic floor muscles, tissues edema \\nor following regional anesthesia. Residual urine is \\nmeasured after micturition with ultrasound scan or \\nby a catheter. Recatheterization should be done if the \\nresidual urine is >100 mL. catheter may have to be \\nkept for 24–48 hours.\\nMobilization:  The patient should be encouraged \\nto move freely in bed and to lie in any posture \\ncomfortable to her. Deep breathing and movements \\nof the legs and arms are encouraged to minimize \\nleg vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It is \\nadvantageous to allow the patient to sit or to stand \\nby the side of the bed by the evening. The patient can \\nhave sips of water to relieve the thirst.\\nFirst postoperative day\\nGeneral care: The patient is expected to look better \\nand fresh. Vital signs are noted at least twice daily. \\nAbdominal auscultation is done for appearance \\nof peristaltic sounds. Enquiry is to be made about \\nthe passage of flatus. Vaginal plug (if any) is to \\nbe removed early in the morning. The patient is \\nencouraged to stand or to walk few steps by the side \\nof the bed and to sit on the bedside or on a chair. Deep \\nbreathing exercises and leg and arm movements while \\non bed are encouraged.\\nDiet: Oral feeding in the form of plain or electrolyte \\nwater is given in small but frequent intervals. With \\nthe appearance of bowel sounds or passage of flatus, \\nfull liquid diet is prescribed.\\nHowever, early postoperative feeding is safe. Early \\nfeeding (< 24 hours) does not cause any increase in \\nparalytic ileus, vomiting or abdominal distension. \\nEach case needs to be individualized.\\nSedative and analgesics:  Parenteral analgesics are \\ngradually replaced with oral drugs (paracetamol, \\naspirin and NSAIDs) in combination.\\nSecond postoperative day\\n \\x9d The patient feels comfortable and looks fresh.\\n \\x9d She moves around in the room and goes to toilet.\\n \\x9d Light solid diet of patient’s choice is given.\\n \\x9d Self-retaining catheter is removed.\\nThird and fourth postoperative days\\n \\x9d Daily observation of vital signs twice daily is to \\nbe done as a routine.\\n \\x9d The diet is gradually brought to her normal.\\n \\x9d The bowels usually move normally, otherwise low \\nenema or suppository may be given.\\nFifth and sixth postoperative days\\nThe abdominal stitches are usually removed on the 5th \\nday in transverse incision and on 6th day in vertical \\nincision.

He used a simple tube and candle \\nlight to visualize the interior of the urethra. Pantaleoni of \\nIreland first used a cystoscope in 1869 as an hysteroscope \\nto diagnose a case of irregular vaginal bleeding. Jacobaeus \\nof Sweden in 1910 first introduced a cystoscope in the \\nperitoneal cavity and coined the term laparoscopy. In 1938, \\nVeress first reported the spring loaded needle for creating \\npneumothorax in patients with tuberculosis. In 1947, Raoul \\nPalmer of France introduced the use of gaseous distension \\nof the peritoneal cavity using gas and the lithotomy \\n(Trendelenburg) position.

Lateral thermal spread \\nis minimal. Coagulation mode creates peak voltage \\nthree times higher than of cutting made. It causes \\nrapid tissue desication and carbonization. In blended \\nmode cutting and coagulation currents are combined \\ncreating alternate high and low voltage current.\\nMonopolar Electrosurgery: The current (electrons) \\nis pushed from the generator through the active \\nelectrode to the contact tissue. The current returns \\nback to generator through the neutral electrode after \\nit has passed through the patient.\\nIt is important to check the return electrode is \\nin good contact with the patient. It should be broad \\nenough to reduce the current density far below the \\nlevel of tissue burning.\\nDepending upon the size of the electrodes (current \\ndensity) and voltage used, unwanted burns may be \\nproduced due to stray current flow.\\nBipolar Electrosurgery: Here the current flows \\nfrom the generator between the two jaws of the \\nforceps or scissors, holding the target tissue (Fig. \\n35.6). There is no need for ground plate. Bipolar \\nenergy is very effective for hemstasis. It works by \\nconducting electrical current with high power density \\nthat is confined between the jaws of the forceps. It has \\nlimited lateral thermal spread, low contact temperature \\nand high compressive effects. Damage to tissue is \\nmore precise compared to unipolar mode.\\nLaser Coagulation (see p. 123): Lasers used in \\ngynecological surgery are CO2, KTP-532 and Nd: YAG \\nlasers. For effective cutting, vaporization and coagulation \\nof tissue, power density is an important factor. The depth \\nof tissue penetration depends on the type of laser used, \\ne.g. for CO2 (most commonly used) 0.1 mm, KTP-532—\\n0.4–0.8 mm and Nd: YAG is 0.6-4.2 mm (see p. 123).\\nLigaSure is a bipolar electrosurgical device used \\nto cut, vaporize, coagulate and seal blood vessels. \\nIt delivers electrical energy as high current and low \\nvoltage output. The problem of sticking and charring \\nto tissues are less. Lateral thermal spread is also less. \\nIt seals blood vessels, up to 7 mm in size.\\nEnseal Vessel Fusion is a bipolar system that deliver \\na locally regulated current. Tissue temperature remains \\nwithin 120oC as there is generation of resistance in \\nthe plastic jaws of the instrument. The device has a \\nmechanical blade that can be advanced gradually to \\ndesiccate and cut tissue bundles.\\nHarmonic scalpel: It is an ultrasound energy source \\nto break hydrogen bonds in tissues.

If the needle \\nplacement is correct, the fluid cannot be withdrawn as \\nit goes in the peritoneal cavity.\\n(c) Intra-abdominal pressure is low (<10 mm Hg) on \\ncorrect placement and there is free flow of gas.\\n(d) Obliteration of liver dullness (on percussion).\\nOther possible sites of veress needle insertion:\\n(a) Left subcostal margin [3 cm below in midclavicular \\nline–Palmer’s point]. Stomach must be decompressed and \\nsplenomegaly to be ruled out. (b) Transvaginal—through \\nthe pouch of Douglas.\\nLaparoscopic Insufflator\\nOperative laparoscopic procedures needs high flow. \\nAutomatic sensors of the insufflator shut off gas flow when \\nthe intra-abdominal pressure reaches 15 to 20 mm Hg. \\nPort Entry (Fig. 35.5):  Peritoneal cavity is entered \\nthrough three main sites: (i) At the umbilicus (most \\ncommon). (ii) Suprapubic (2-4 cm above). (iii) Palmer’s \\npoint (midclavicular line) on the left. In obese patients the \\nneedle is inserted more vertically.\\nintroduction of trocar and cannula\\nThe abdominal wall is elevated and the trocar with \\ncannula is inserted through the same incision. The angle \\nof insertion is similar to that of the veress needle, directing \\ntowards the hollow of the sacrum. There is escape of gas \\nwhen the trocar is within the peritoneal cavity. The trocar  \\nis removed and the laparoscope is then introduced. Open \\nlaparoscopy was introduced (Hasson-1971) to reduce the \\nrisk of blind insertion of the veress needles and trocars. \\nPeritoneal cavity is opened through a small incision (1 \\ncm) at the umbilicus pneumoperitoneum is done through \\na special cannula inserted in the incision. The laparoscope \\nis then introduced. \\nSecondary trocar insertion is needed for both the \\ndiagnostic and operative procedures (see Fig. 35.5). \\nSites selected are either on the flank (3–4 cm lateral to \\nthe medial umbilical ligament) or lateral to the lateral \\nmargin of rectus abdominis muscle or on the suprapubic \\nregion. This is done under direct vision with illumination \\nto avoid trauma to abdominal organs and the inferior \\nepigastric vessels.\\nLaparoscopic procedures of tissue dissection: \\n(i) Blunt dissection. (ii) Sharp dissection (using \\nscissors). For control of bleeding, bipolar diathermy \\nis used for hemostasis. (iii) Aquadissection with \\nhydraulic pressure is used to create tissue planes. (iv) \\nElectrodissection using unipolar or bipolar diathermy \\nfor dissection and coagulation. (v) Laser dissection \\n(see p. 123). (vi) Harmonic scalpel.\\nMethods of hemostasis (see p. 613).\\nRemoval of specimens: Large volume of tissues \\nafter laparoscope could be removed by any of these \\nmethods: (i) Morcellation. (ii) By enlarging any of \\nthe suprapubic trocar incision site. (iii) Through \\nthe colpotomy incision. The specimen is put in a \\nEndoCatch bag and is taken out without spilling. \\nfig. 35.5: Port Entry: A. Primary port- Umbilical port. \\nB1 and B2.

In gynecology \\nas much as 80 percent of operations can be performed endoscopically with the use of either a laparoscope or \\na hysteroscope.\\n \\uf086 During laparoscopy, the magniﬁ  cation of the object depends upon the distance of the laparoscope from the \\nobject. With ‘Storz’ it is nearly 10 times when working distance is 3 mm and is 1 when the distance is 30 mm.\\n \\uf086 Laparoscopic surgery could be diagnostic (see p. 121) or therapeutic (see p. 617). Before any procedure is \\nundertaken, contraindications must be carefully excluded (Table 35.1). Informed consent should include the \\npermission for open surgery if necessity arises.\\n \\uf086 Hemostasis during laparoscopic surgery can be achieved using electrocoagulation (monopolar/bipolar), \\nlaser coagulation, ligatures, sutures(extracorporeal/intra-corporeal), enseal, harmonic scalpel or by stapler \\nand clips. (p. 613) \\n \\uf086 Thermal damage caused by electrosurgery or laser depends on the degree of` heat applied to the tissues. \\nTissue damage with heat is as follows: 45°C = Tissue death; 70°C = Coagulation; ≥ 90°C = Desiccation; \\n≥ 100°C = Vaporization; ≥ 200°C = Carbonization (charring).\\n \\uf086 Laparoscopic tubal sterilization is the commonest surgical procedure. In LAVH the uterine arteries are clamped \\nand secured through vaginal route. In TLH (p. 617) entire procedure is done laparoscopically. \\n \\uf086 Complications of laparoscopy may be due to the procedure itself or due to anesthesia (see p. 619).\\n \\uf086 Hysteroscopy is superior to HSG . The distending media commonly used in hysteroscopy is normal saline or \\nglycine (1.5 %).\\n \\uf086 The contraindications (see p. 622) of hysteroscopy are pelvic infection, pregnancy and active uterine bleeding. \\nComplications include ﬂ  uid overload, pulmonary edema, and injury to genital or abdominal organs or \\nelectrosurgical injuries (see p. 623).\\n \\uf086 Hysteroscopic surgery should be done in the postmenstrual phase.

Collagen is derived \\nfrom ox Achilles tendon. Both are available in plain and \\nchromic form. Treatment with chromic sulfate produces \\nchromic catgut and the untreated material produces plain \\ncatgut. Chromic catgut is degraded by proteolytic enzymes \\nof white blood cells (inflammatory cells) slowly. Chromic \\ncatgut loses half of its tensile strength by 10 days and \\nmaintains some strength upto 21 days. Plain catgut loses \\n70 percent of its tensile strength by 7 days.\\nSynthetic\\n ♦ Dexon:  Dexon (polyglycolic acid) is a copolymer \\nof glycolic acid and is degraded by hydrolysis with \\nminimal inflammation. It loses half of its tensile \\nstrength in 15 days and is absorbed in 4 months.\\n ♦ Vicryl (coated): Vicryl (polyglactin) is a copolymer of \\nlactide and glycolide. It loses its tensile strength in 30 \\ndays. It is absorbed by 70 days. It produces less tissue \\nreaction than catgut.\\nVicryl rapide (coated): It is also a polyglactin suture. It is \\nsimilar to plain catgut. Absorption is rapid with minimal \\ntissue inflammation. 70 percent of its tensile strength is lost \\nby 7 days. It is used for repair of soft tissues, episiotomy \\nrepair and skin.\\nThe tensile strength of the above sutures is much greater \\nthan that of catgut. But these sutures need more throws to \\nsecure knots compared to catgut. \\n ♦ Polydioxanone suture (PDS) is a pliable mono-filament \\nmade of polydioxanone. It loses half of its tensile \\nstrength in 28 days. Tissue inflammation is minimal. \\nMonofilament sutures have no interstices to lodge any \\nbacteria. So infections are rare. Polyglyconate sutures \\nhave got similar properties. These are used for fascial \\nclosure. \\n  All the synthetic absorbable materials are sterilized \\nby ethylene oxide.\\nnonabsorbable: • Biological • Synthetic\\nBiological\\n ♦ Silk suture can be handled and tied easily. It has \\nexcellent knot security. It is sterilized by gamma \\nradiation. It is a foreign protein and initiates strong \\ninflammatory response and loses half of its tensile \\nstrength by 1 year. It should not be used in contaminated \\nor infected tissue.\\n ♦ Cotton is the weakest nonabsorbable suture. It loses 50 \\npercent of the tensile strength by 6 months. Wet cotton \\nis stronger (10%) than dry cotton. It is rarely used now.\\nSynthetic\\n ♦ Terelene or Dacron:  These are extruded from a \\nhomopolymer.\\n ♦ Polyamide (Nylon): It is a man made mono-  \\nfilament or multifilament. It is very much nonreactive \\nin tissues. Monofilament nylon has greater tensile \\nstrength, incites less tissue reaction and is less prone \\nto infection than braided nylon.\\n ♦ Polypropylene (Prolene) is a hydrocarbon polymer \\nand is monofilament. It has least tissue reaction. Knot \\nsecurity is greater. It is sterilized by ethylene oxide.\\n ♦ Steel suture is nonreactive and has highest tensile \\nstrength. It is not commonly used now.\\nNonabsorbable sutures maintain their tensile strength \\nfor a long time.

       "'WHAT HAPPENS  \\nIN LABOUR\\nThere are three stages to labour.  \\nIn the ﬁrst stage the cervix gradually \\nopens up (dilates). In the second \\nstage the baby is pushed down \\nthe vagina and is born. In the third \\nstage the placenta comes away \\nfrom the wall of the uterus and  \\nis also pushed out of the vagina.\\nThe ﬁrst stage of \\nlabour – dilation\\nThe dilation of the cervix\\nThe cervix needs to open to \\nabout 10cm for a baby to pass \\nthrough. This is called ‘fully dilated’. \\nContractions at the start of labour \\nhelp to soften the cervix so that it \\ngradually opens. Sometimes the \\nprocess of softening can take many \\nhours before what midwives refer  \\nto as ‘established labour’. This is \\nwhen your cervix has dilated to at \\nleast 4cm.\\nIf you go into hospital or your \\nmidwifery unit before labour is \\nestablished, you may be asked if \\nyou would prefer to go home again \\nfor a while, rather than spending \\nextra hours in hospital. \\nIf you go home, you should make \\nsure that you eat and drink, as you \\nwill need energy. At night, try to  \\nget comfortable and relaxed. \\nIf you can, try to sleep. A warm bath \\nor shower may help you to relax. \\nDuring the day, keep upright and \\ngently active. This helps the baby \\nto move down into the pelvis and \\nhelps the cervix to dilate. \\nOnce labour is established, the \\nmidwife will check you from  \\ntime to time to see how you are \\nprogressing. In a ﬁrst labour, the \\ntime from the start of established \\nlabour to full dilation can be \\nbetween 6 and 12 hours. It is  \\noften quicker in subsequent \\npregnancies.\\nYour midwife should be with  \\nyou all the time to support you.  \\nShe will tell you to try not to push \\nuntil your cervix is fully open and \\nthe baby’s head can be seen.  \\nTo help yourself get over the urge \\nto push, try blowing out slowly  \\nand gently or, if the urge is too \\nstrong, in little puffs. Some people \\nﬁnd this easier lying on their side, \\nor on their knees and elbows, to \\nreduce the pressure of the baby’s \\nhead on the cervix.\\nFetal heart monitoring\\nYour baby’s heart will be monitored \\nthroughout labour. Your midwife \\nwill watch for any marked change  \\nin your baby’s heart rate, which \\ncould be a sign that the baby is \\ndistressed and that something \\nneeds to be done to speed up the \\ndelivery. There are different ways  \\nof monitoring the baby’s heartbeat. \\nIf you don’t feel comfortable with \\none of these, tell your midwife.\\n• Your midwife may listen to your \\nbaby’s heart intermittently, but \\nfor at least one minute every \\n15 minutes when you are in \\nestablished labour, using a  \\nhand-held ultrasound monitor \\n(often called a Sonicaid). This \\nmethod allows you to be free  \\nto move around.\\n92'"

It is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections and can lead to serious complications if left untreated.\\n\\n4. Endometriosis: This is a condition in which the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pain and discomfort. It can also lead to fertility problems.\\n\\n5. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects many women. It is characterized by irregular periods, excess hair growth, and cysts on the ovaries.\\n\\n6. Fibroids: Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in the uterus. They can cause heavy or painful periods, and in some cases, may affect fertility.\\n\\n7. Menopause: Menopause is a natural process that marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. It is accompanied by a decrease in estrogen levels and can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and vaginal dryness.\\n\\n8.
